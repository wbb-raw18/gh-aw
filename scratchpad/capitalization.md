The gh-aw CLI follows context-based capitalization to distinguish between the product name and generic workflow references in user-facing text.

## Capitalization Rules

The CLI uses different capitalization based on context:

| Context | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Product name | **Capitalized** | "GitHub Agentic Workflows CLI from GitHub Next" |
| Generic workflows | **Lowercase** | "Enable agentic workflows" |
| Technical terms | **Capitalized** | "Compile Markdown workflows to GitHub Actions YAML" |

## Design Rationale

This capitalization convention distinguishes between the product name (GitHub Agentic Workflows) and the concept (agentic workflows), following industry standards similar to "GitHub Actions" vs. "actions". The consistent pattern across all commands, help text, and documentation reduces ambiguity for contributors.

## Examples

### Product References (Capitalized)

When referring to the gh-aw tool or GitHub Agentic Workflows as a product:

```text
GitHub Agentic Workflows CLI from GitHub Next
GitHub Agentic Workflows from GitHub Next
```

### Generic Workflow References (Lowercase)

When describing actions performed on workflows:

```text
Enable agentic workflows
Initialize repository for agentic workflows
Download and analyze agentic workflow logs
Add an MCP tool to an agentic workflow
```

### Technical Terms (Capitalized)

Proper nouns and acronyms maintain their standard capitalization:

```text
Compile Markdown workflows to GitHub Actions YAML
MCP helpers
```

## Decision Flow

Use this flowchart to determine the correct capitalization:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Text to Write] --> B{What are you referring to?}
    B -->|The product/tool itself| C[Capitalized:<br/>'GitHub Agentic Workflows']
    B -->|Actions on workflows| D[Lowercase:<br/>'agentic workflows']
    B -->|Technical terms/acronyms| E[Standard:<br/>'MCP', 'YAML', 'Compile']

    C --> F[Examples:<br/>'GitHub Agentic Workflows CLI'<br/>'GitHub Agentic Workflows from GitHub Next']
    D --> G[Examples:<br/>'Enable agentic workflows'<br/>'Initialize repository for agentic workflows'<br/>'Download agentic workflow logs']
    E --> H[Examples:<br/>'Compile Markdown workflows to GitHub Actions YAML'<br/>'MCP helpers']
```

## Implementation

The capitalization rules are enforced through automated tests in `cmd/gh-aw/capitalization_test.go`. These tests verify:

- Product name uses "GitHub Agentic Workflows" (capitalized)
- Generic workflow references use "agentic workflows" (lowercase)
- Technical terms maintain proper capitalization

The tests run as part of the standard test suite and prevent inconsistencies from being introduced.
