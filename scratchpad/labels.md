# Label Guidelines

## Purpose of Labels

Labels help organize and triage issues for project management. Use labels to:
- Categorize issue type (bug, enhancement, documentation)
- Indicate priority level
- Mark workflow automation status
- Identify component areas

## Label Categories

### Type Labels (choose one)
- **bug** - Something isn't working correctly
- **enhancement** - New feature or improvement request
- **documentation** - Documentation improvements or additions
- **question** - Questions about usage or behavior
- **testing** - Test-related issues

### Priority Labels (optional)
- **priority-high** - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **priority-medium** - Important but not urgent
- **priority-low** - Lower-priority improvements

### Component Labels (optional, choose multiple if needed)
- **cli** - Command-line interface
- **workflow** - Workflow compilation and processing
- **mcp** - MCP server integration
- **actions** - GitHub Actions integration
- **engine** - AI engine configuration

### Workflow Automation Labels (managed by automation)
- **ai-generated** - Issue created by AI workflow (Plan Command, etc.)
- **plan** - Planning issue with sub-tasks
- **ai-inspected** - Issue reviewed by AI workflow
- **smoke-copilot** - Smoke test results

### Domain Labels (used by scheduled workflows)
- **constraint-solving** - Constraint solving problems and algorithms (used by Constraint Solving POTD workflow)
- **problem-of-the-day** - Problem of the day (used by Constraint Solving POTD workflow)

### Status Labels
- **good first issue** - Suitable for new contributors
- **dependencies** - Dependency updates

## Label Usage Best Practices

### When to Add Labels

**During Issue Creation:**
- Add a type label (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)
- Add priority if urgent
- Add relevant component labels

**During Triage:**
- Review and update labels based on discussion
- Add `good first issue` for newcomer-friendly tasks
- Set priority based on impact

**Automation Labels:**
- `ai-generated` and `plan` are automatically added by workflows
- These should not be manually added or removed
- They help track AI-assisted issue creation and planning

### When to Remove Labels

**For Workflow Labels:**
- `plan` labels may be removed after all sub-tasks are completed
- Keep `ai-generated` for historical tracking
- Don't remove automation labels unless the issue was incorrectly tagged

**For Other Labels:**
- Update priority labels as urgency changes
- Remove incorrect type or component labels during triage

### Label Lifecycle

**AI-Generated Planning Issues:**
1. Created with `plan` + `ai-generated` labels
2. Add type and component labels for better categorization
3. Monitor sub-task completion
4. Consider removing `plan` label when all sub-tasks are complete
5. Close issue when work is done, keeping labels for historical reference

**Manual Issues:**
1. Created with type label (bug, enhancement, etc.)
2. Add component and priority labels during triage
3. Update labels as issue evolves
4. Close when resolved

## Label Hygiene

**Regular Maintenance:**
- Review unlabeled issues weekly and add appropriate labels
- Update priority labels as project needs change
- Ensure all open issues have at least a type label

**Avoiding Label Overload:**
- Use 2-4 labels per issue for effective filtering
- Don't duplicate information (e.g., title already says "bug")
- Prefer specific component labels over generic ones

## Label Taxonomy

**Current Label Structure:**
```text
Type: bug, enhancement, documentation, question, testing
Priority: priority-high, priority-medium, priority-low
Component: cli, workflow, mcp, actions, engine, automation
Workflow: ai-generated, plan, ai-inspected, smoke-copilot
Domain: constraint-solving, problem-of-the-day
Status: good first issue, dependencies
```

This taxonomy provides clear filtering while avoiding label sprawl. Use GitHub's issue search to combine labels effectively:
- `is:issue is:open label:bug label:priority-high` - Critical bugs
- `is:issue is:open label:enhancement label:good first issue` - Beginner-friendly enhancements
- `is:issue is:open label:plan` - Active planning issues

## Label Distribution Analysis

### Current State

Analysis of the repository (as of December 2024) shows:
- **Total open issues**: 35
- **Issues with `plan`**: 16 (45.7%)
- **Issues with `ai-generated`**: 16 (45.7%)
- **100% overlap**: All `plan` issues also have `ai-generated`
- **Unlabeled issues**: 0 (100% labeled)

### Key Findings

**The label distribution reflects expected usage and is working as intended.** The high percentage of workflow labels reflects active AI-assisted planning, not a labeling problem.

**Why this is not a concern:**
1. Labels reflect actual project activity (active AI planning)
2. Clear distinction between automated and manual issues
3. Effective filtering with label combinations
4. Transparent AI attribution
5. Additional labels (type, component, priority) provide needed categorization

### Recommendations

✅ **Keep current structure** - No changes needed to `plan`/`ai-generated` labels
- Working as designed
- Serves clear purpose for tracking AI-generated planning issues
- Enables effective filtering with combinations

❌ **Do not create `plan-*` subcategories** - Adds complexity without benefit
- Current system handles this with `is:open` / `is:closed` filters
- Would fragment label space

🔄 **Optional** (low priority): Remove `plan` label after sub-tasks complete
- Would make it an "active planning" indicator
- Keep `ai-generated` for historical tracking
- Not required, current approach is also valid

✅ **Monitor** for true label skew
- Watch type/priority labels (not workflow labels)
- Quarterly review recommended
- Warning signs: A type label exceeding 60% of open issues

## Success Metrics

✅ Zero unlabeled open issues  
✅ Clear distinction between automated and manual issues  
✅ Effective filtering with label combinations  
✅ Transparent AI attribution maintained
