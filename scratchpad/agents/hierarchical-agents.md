# Hierarchical Agent Management

This document describes the hierarchical agent management system in GitHub Agentic Workflows, which provides meta-orchestration capabilities to manage the 120+ agents in the repository.

## Overview

The hierarchical agent system consists of specialized meta-orchestrator workflows that oversee, coordinate, and optimize the agent ecosystem. These meta-orchestrator agents operate at a higher level than regular workflows, monitoring and managing multiple agents to ensure overall system health and effectiveness.

### Key Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Each meta-orchestrator has a distinct focus area
2. **Non-Intrusive:** Meta-orchestrators observe and recommend, they don't directly control workers
3. **Evidence-Based:** All decisions based on concrete metrics and data
4. **Actionable:** Outputs are specific recommendations with clear next steps
5. **Coordinated:** Meta-orchestrators complement each other without overlap
6. **Shared Memory:** Meta-orchestrators use common repo memory to share insights and coordinate actions

### Shared Memory System

Meta-orchestrators use a shared repository memory branch (`memory/meta-orchestrators`) to persist data across runs and coordinate with each other.

**Memory Location:** `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-default/memory/meta-orchestrators/`

**Shared Files:**
- `campaign-manager-latest.md` - Campaign portfolio health and decisions
- `workflow-health-latest.md` - Workflow compilation and execution status
- `agent-performance-latest.md` - Agent quality scores and patterns
- `shared-alerts.md` - Cross-orchestrator coordination notes and alerts

**Benefits:**
- **Avoid Duplicate Work:** Each orchestrator can see what others have already flagged
- **Coordinate Actions:** Orchestrators can build on each other's insights
- **Track Trends:** Historical data enables trend analysis across runs
- **Share Context:** Common understanding of ecosystem state

**Example Use Cases:**
- Campaign Manager sees that Workflow Health Manager flagged a failing workflow used by Campaign X
- Workflow Health Manager identifies that Agent Performance Analyzer found quality issues in a specific workflow
- Agent Performance Analyzer notes that Campaign Manager deprioritized a campaign, reducing urgency of related improvements

### Safeguards

The shared memory path `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-default/memory/meta-orchestrators/` is ephemeral and may be absent or unreadable at runtime. Meta-orchestrators **must** treat it as optional and degrade gracefully under the following failure modes:

1. **Memory path missing (fresh environment):** The `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-default/` directory may not exist on the first run or in a freshly provisioned runner. Each meta-orchestrator must check for path existence before reading and continue without historical context if the directory is absent. No error should be surfaced to the user; instead, the orchestrator starts with an empty baseline.

2. **Memory branch unreadable (checkout failure):** If the `memory/meta-orchestrators` branch fails to check out (e.g., the branch was deleted, a network error occurred, or the repo-memory action is unavailable), the orchestrator must log a warning and proceed with in-session data only. Avoid writing to a failed checkout path, as doing so could corrupt subsequent reads.

3. **Stale or corrupted memory file:** A shared file (e.g., `shared-alerts.md`) may contain truncated content due to a previous run crashing mid-write. Each orchestrator must validate that the file is parseable before consuming it. If parsing fails, the file should be treated as absent and overwritten with a fresh snapshot at the end of the run.

4. **Concurrent write collision:** All three meta-orchestrators run on the same daily schedule and could write to the same memory branch simultaneously. Memory writes must be treated as best-effort: if a push fails due to a concurrent update, the orchestrator logs a warning and proceeds without blocking. Consumers must tolerate reading a version written by a sibling run from the previous cycle.

5. **Permission denied on memory branch:** If the GitHub token used for the run lacks permission to push to the `memory/meta-orchestrators` branch (e.g., PR-scoped token restrictions), the orchestrator must skip the write step and emit a single warning rather than failing the entire run.

### Operations Order

When all three meta-orchestrators are triggered simultaneously (e.g., on the same daily schedule), the following order governs their execution and memory access:

1. **Workflow Health Manager** — runs first. It has no dependency on the other orchestrators' outputs and produces the foundational health snapshot (`workflow-health-latest.md`) that the other two may read.
2. **Campaign Manager** — runs second. It reads the workflow health snapshot to cross-reference failing workflows against active campaigns before writing `campaign-manager-latest.md`.
3. **Agent Performance Analyzer** — runs third. It reads both workflow health and campaign data to provide context-aware quality assessments and writes `agent-performance-latest.md`.

**Concurrency contract:** Because the three workflows are scheduled independently and GitHub Actions does not guarantee serial execution, they may overlap. Each orchestrator must be designed to produce a correct result using only the memory snapshot present at its *start*, without assuming that sibling orchestrators have already completed. The ordering above is the *recommended* sequence for coordinated scheduling; it is not enforced by the platform.

## How Meta-Orchestrators Work

### Discovery

All meta-orchestrators start by discovering the current state:
- Scan repository for relevant files (workflows, campaigns, etc.)
- Parse metadata and configuration
- Build an inventory of what they manage

### Analysis

Meta-orchestrators analyze the discovered data:
- Calculate health scores and metrics
- Identify patterns and trends
- Detect issues and opportunities
- Compare against baselines and expectations

### Decision Making

Based on analysis, meta-orchestrators make strategic decisions:
- Prioritize issues (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- Generate specific recommendations
- Identify action items
- Determine what needs escalation

### Execution

Meta-orchestrators take action through safe outputs:
- Create issues for problems that need fixing
- Generate reports and discussions for visibility
- Add comments to provide context and guidance
- Update project boards to adjust priorities

### Reporting

Meta-orchestrators provide detailed reports including:
- Executive summaries for high-level overview
- Detailed findings for investigation
- Actionable recommendations for improvement
- Trends and metrics for tracking progress

## Using Meta-Orchestrators
