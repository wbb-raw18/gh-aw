# Workflow Refactoring Patterns

This document describes the patterns and practices used for refactoring large agentic workflows into smaller, maintainable modules.

## Overview

The workflow complexity reduction initiative addresses workflows that have grown to excessive size (600+ lines), making them difficult to maintain, debug, and test. This document captures the refactoring patterns used to modularize these workflows.

## Refactoring Principles

### 1. Extract Common Functionality

Move reusable components to `.github/workflows/shared/` directory:
- **Data collection modules**: Pre-fetch and prepare data (e.g., `copilot-session-data-fetch.md`)
- **Analysis strategies**: Reusable analytical patterns (e.g., `session-analysis-strategies.md`)
- **Visualization modules**: Chart generation and data visualization (e.g., `session-analysis-charts.md`)
- **Utility modules**: Common utilities like `reporting.md`, `python-dataviz.md`, `trends.md`

### 2. Split by Concern

Separate workflows into distinct phases:
- **Data collection**: Fetch and prepare input data
- **Analysis**: Process and analyze data
- **Visualization**: Generate charts and visualizations
- **Reporting**: Create discussions, issues, or PRs

### 3. Use Imports for Composition

Compose workflows from shared modules using `imports:`:

```yaml
imports:
  - shared/copilot-session-data-fetch.md
  - shared/session-analysis-charts.md
  - shared/session-analysis-strategies.md
  - shared/reporting.md
```

## Size Guidelines

- **Target**: 400-500 lines maximum per workflow
- **Ideal**: 200-300 lines for most workflows
- **Hard limit**: 600 lines (refactor above this)

## Refactoring Pattern Examples

### Example 1: Session Analysis Workflow

**Before** (748 lines):
```markdown
---
imports:
  - shared/copilot-session-data-fetch.md
  - shared/reporting.md
  - shared/trends.md
---

# Copilot Agent Session Analysis

[... 748 lines of mixed concerns: chart generation, analysis strategies, reporting templates ...]
```

**After** (403 lines):

**Main workflow** (`copilot-session-insights.md`):
```markdown
---
imports:
  - shared/copilot-session-data-fetch.md
  - shared/session-analysis-charts.md
  - shared/session-analysis-strategies.md
  - shared/reporting.md
---

# Copilot Agent Session Analysis

## Mission
[High-level mission and context]

## Task Overview
[Reference shared modules for implementation details]
```

**Extracted modules**:
- `shared/session-analysis-charts.md` (117 lines): Chart generation patterns and requirements
- `shared/session-analysis-strategies.md` (201 lines): Analysis strategies and patterns

### Example 2: CI Optimization Workflow

**Before** (725 lines):
```markdown
---
[Long steps section with data download, build, test setup]
---

# CI Optimization Coach

[... 725 lines of mixed concerns: data collection, test coverage analysis, optimization strategies ...]
```

**After** (280 lines):

**Main workflow** (`ci-coach.md`):
```markdown
---
imports:
  - shared/ci-data-analysis.md
  - shared/ci-optimization-strategies.md
  - shared/reporting.md
---

# CI Optimization Coach

## Analysis Framework
[Reference shared modules for strategies]
```

**Extracted modules**:
- `shared/ci-data-analysis.md` (154 lines): Data collection, build, and test execution
- `shared/ci-optimization-strategies.md` (186 lines): Optimization analysis patterns

## Shared Module Structure

### Data Collection Modules

Pattern for modules that fetch and prepare data:

```markdown
---
# Module name and description
#
# Usage:
#   imports:
#     - shared/module-name.md
#
# This import provides:
# - List of capabilities

imports:
  - shared/dependency.md  # If needed

tools:
  cache-memory: true
  bash: ["*"]

steps:
  - name: Fetch data
    run: |
      # Data collection logic
---

# Module Documentation

Available data:
- Location 1: Description
- Location 2: Description

Usage examples:
```bash
# How to use the collected data
```
```

### Analysis Strategies Modules

Pattern for modules that define analytical approaches:

```markdown
---
# Module name and description
#
# Usage:
#   imports:
#     - shared/module-name.md
---

# Strategy Name

## Standard Strategies

### Strategy 1: Name
- Description
- When to use
- Expected output

### Strategy 2: Name
- Description
- When to use
- Expected output

## Advanced Strategies

[More complex or experimental strategies]
```

### Visualization Modules

Pattern for modules that generate charts and visualizations:

```markdown
---
# Module name and description
#
# Usage:
#   imports:
#     - shared/module-name.md

imports:
  - shared/python-dataviz.md  # For Python-based charts
---

# Chart Generation

## Chart 1: Name
- Description
- Data requirements
- Output location
- Implementation pattern

## Chart 2: Name
- Description
- Data requirements
- Output location
- Implementation pattern
```

## Refactoring Checklist

When refactoring a large workflow:

- [ ] Identify distinct concerns in the workflow
- [ ] Extract data collection steps to shared module
- [ ] Extract analysis strategies to shared module
- [ ] Extract visualization logic to shared module (if applicable)
- [ ] Update main workflow to use imports
- [ ] Verify workflow compiles successfully
- [ ] Check that line count is < 500 (ideally 200-400)
- [ ] Test workflow functionality
- [ ] Document extracted modules with clear usage examples

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- Focused modules are easier to understand
- Changes to shared logic propagate to all workflows
- Clear separation of concerns

### Testability
- Smaller modules reduce test scope
- Shared modules can be tested independently
- Reduced cognitive load for reviewers

### Reusability
- Shared modules serve multiple workflows
- Common patterns defined once
- New workflows can import existing modules

### Debugging
- Module boundaries isolate failure scope
- Error messages include specific module context
- Issues are localized to a single concern

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Data Fetch + Analysis + Visualization

```
Main Workflow (300 lines)
├── Import: data-fetch.md (150 lines)
├── Import: analysis-strategies.md (200 lines)
├── Import: visualization.md (120 lines)
└── Import: reporting.md (15 lines)
```

### Pattern: Build + Analyze + Propose Changes

```
Main Workflow (280 lines)
├── Import: build-and-test.md (180 lines)
├── Import: optimization-strategies.md (190 lines)
└── Import: reporting.md (15 lines)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't over-extract**: Keep related logic together. Not every 50-line section needs to be a separate module.
   - **Bad example**: Extracting a 30-line section just because it's slightly different
   - **Good example**: Extracting a 150-line section that's used by 3+ workflows

❌ **Don't create circular dependencies**: Shared modules should not import each other in circular ways.
   - **Bad example**: Module A imports Module B, which imports Module C, which imports Module A
   - **Good example**: Linear dependency chain: Main → Module A → Module B

❌ **Don't duplicate shared logic**: If two modules need the same setup, extract it to a common base module.
   - **Bad example**: Both `data-analysis-a.md` and `data-analysis-b.md` have identical data fetch code
   - **Good example**: Extract common data fetch to `data-fetch.md`, both modules import it

❌ **Don't make modules too generic**: Modules should be focused and purposeful, not catch-all utilities.
   - **Bad example**: `shared/utilities.md` with 500 lines of unrelated functions
   - **Good example**: `shared/python-dataviz.md` focused on data visualization setup

## Success Metrics

A successful refactoring achieves:
- ✅ Main workflow < 500 lines (ideally 200-400)
- ✅ No more than 3 distinct concerns per workflow
- ✅ Reusable shared modules with clear purpose
- ✅ Workflow compiles without errors
- ✅ Functionality preserved (verified by testing)
