# Daily Reports Metrics Glossary

This document defines standardized metric names and scopes used across all daily report workflows in the gh-aw repository. Using consistent terminology enables accurate cross-report comparisons and reduces confusion when analyzing data from multiple sources.

## Purpose

Each daily report workflow was originally developed independently, leading to inconsistent metric naming. This glossary establishes canonical names and definitions for common metrics to:

- Enable accurate cross-report comparisons
- Reduce ambiguity in metric interpretation
- Provide clear scope documentation for each metric
- Support regulatory validation and trend analysis

## How to Use This Glossary

When implementing or updating daily report workflows:

1. **Use standardized metric names** from this glossary
2. **Document scope with comments** in Python/shell scripts
3. **Reference this glossary** when comparing metrics across reports
4. **Add new metrics** to this glossary when introducing novel measurements

## Issue Metrics

**Definition**: Total number of network requests made through the firewall

**Scope**: All requests logged in Squid access.log files

**Used By**:
- Daily Firewall Report

**Python Variable**: `firewall_requests_total`

## Code Quality Metrics

### total_loc / lines_of_code_total

**Definition**: Total lines of code in the repository across all languages

**Scope**: Git-tracked files only, calculated with the pinned command `cloc --vcs=git --json --quiet .`. The `--vcs=git` flag makes cloc enumerate files via `git ls-files` rather than walking the working tree, so untracked/build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, etc.) are excluded regardless of what happens to exist in the working tree that run. Always use this exact command — a plain `cloc .` is not reproducible run-to-run and has caused implausible day-over-day LOC swings (see github/gh-aw#55519).

**Used By**:
- Daily Code Metrics Report

**Python Variable**: `lines_of_code_total`

**Standardized Name**: Use `lines_of_code_total` for clarity

**Notes**: Report `cloc_command` and `cloc_file_count` (from `.SUM.nFiles` in the cloc JSON output) alongside this metric so day-over-day scope drift can be detected automatically.

---

### test_loc / test_lines_of_code

**Definition**: Total lines of code in test files

**Scope**: Git-tracked files (via `git ls-files`) matching test patterns (*_test.go, *.test.js, test_*.py, etc.)

**Used By**:
- Daily Code Metrics Report

**Python Variable**: `test_lines_of_code`

**Standardized Name**: Use `test_lines_of_code` for clarity

---

### test_to_source_ratio

**Definition**: Ratio of test code to source code (test LOC / source LOC)

**Scope**: Excludes test files from source LOC calculation

**Used By**:
- Daily Code Metrics Report

**Python Variable**: `test_to_source_ratio`

**Notes**: Values between 0.5-1.0 are typical

---

## Observability Metrics

### runs_with_logs / runs_with_complete_logs

**Definition**: Count of workflow runs that have complete log coverage

**Scope**: Runs with all required log files present (access.log, gateway.jsonl, etc.)

**Used By**:
- Daily Observability Report

**Python Variable**: `runs_with_complete_logs`

**Standardized Name**: Use `runs_with_complete_logs` for clarity

---

### runs_missing_logs / runs_with_missing_logs

**Definition**: Count of workflow runs missing critical log files

**Scope**: Firewall-enabled runs without access.log or MCP runs without gateway.jsonl

**Used By**:
- Daily Observability Report

**Python Variable**: `runs_with_missing_logs`

**Standardized Name**: Use `runs_with_missing_logs` for clarity

---

### observability_coverage_percentage

**Definition**: Percentage of workflow runs with complete observability coverage

**Scope**: (runs_with_complete_logs / total_runs_analyzed) * 100

**Used By**:
- Daily Observability Report

**Python Variable**: `observability_coverage_percentage`

---

## Copilot Agent Metrics

### agent_prs_total

**Definition**: Count of pull requests created by Copilot coding agent during the report window

**Scope**: Copilot PRs where `window_start <= createdAt < window_end`

**Used By**:
- Copilot Agent Analysis

**Python Variable**: `agent_prs_total`

**Standardized Name**: Use `agent_prs_total` for clarity

---

### agent_prs_merged

**Definition**: Count of Copilot coding agent PRs merged during the report window

**Scope**: Copilot PRs where `window_start <= mergedAt < window_end`. Retrieve this independently of the created-in-window cohort so it is directly comparable to `merged_prs`.

**Used By**:
- Copilot Agent Analysis

**Python Variable**: `agent_prs_merged`

**Standardized Name**: Use `agent_prs_merged` for clarity

---

### agent_prs_merged_from_created

**Definition**: Count of Copilot coding agent PRs created during the report window that have merged

**Scope**: Subset of `agent_prs_total` where `mergedAt` is non-null. This creation-cohort metric is only the numerator for `agent_success_rate`; it is not comparable to event-scoped `merged_prs`.

**Used By**:
- Copilot Agent Analysis

**Python Variable**: `agent_prs_merged_from_created`

---

### agent_success_rate

**Definition**: Percentage of the Copilot PRs created during the report window that have merged

**Scope**: `(agent_prs_merged_from_created / agent_prs_total) * 100`, where `agent_prs_merged_from_created` is the subset of the `agent_prs_total` creation cohort that has merged. Do not use the event-scoped `agent_prs_merged` as this denominator's numerator.

**Used By**:
- Copilot Agent Analysis

**Python Variable**: `agent_success_rate`

---

## Cross-Report Comparison Guidelines

### Understanding Scope Differences

When comparing metrics across reports, be aware that identical metric names may have different scopes:

**Example: `issues_analyzed`**
- **Daily Issues Report**: Last 1000 issues (all states)
- **Issue Arborist Report**: Last 100 open issues without parent

These are intentionally different scopes for different purposes. The regulatory report should acknowledge these differences rather than flag them as discrepancies.

### Scope Documentation in Code

Always document the scope of metrics in Python/shell scripts:

```python
# Scope: Open issues created in last 7 days
issues_opened_7d = len(df[
    (df['state'] == 'OPEN') & 
    (df['createdAt'] > now - timedelta(days=7))
])
```

```bash
# Scope: Workflow runs from last 7 days with firewall enabled
firewall_enabled_workflows=$(jq '[.[] | select(.firewall_enabled == true)] | length' runs.json)
```

### Validation Rules

The regulatory report should:

1. **Compare like-with-like**: Only compare metrics with identical scopes
2. **Document scope differences**: Note when metrics have different scopes and explain why
3. **Flag true discrepancies**: Report when metrics with same scope differ by >10%
4. **Reference this glossary**: Link to glossary entries when reporting discrepancies

## Adding New Metrics

When introducing new metrics to daily reports:

1. Add a definition to this glossary with:
   - Standardized name
   - Clear definition
   - Explicit scope documentation
   - Reports that use it
   - Python/shell variable name
2. Update relevant report workflows to use the standardized name
3. Add scope comments in the implementation code
4. Update the regulatory report if cross-comparison is needed

## Version History

- **2026-01-18**: Initial version - standardized metrics across 7+ daily reports
