# Token Budget Guidelines for High-Cost Workflows

## Overview

This document establishes token budget targets and optimization strategies for agentic workflows that consume significant Copilot tokens. These guidelines help maintain cost predictability while preserving analysis quality.

## Purpose

- **Cost Control**: Prevent unbounded token consumption in expensive workflows
- **Predictability**: Establish expected token ranges per workflow run
- **Quality**: Maintain useful outputs while reducing unnecessary verbosity
- **Monitoring**: Enable tracking and alerting when budgets are exceeded

## Token Budget Configuration

### Available Controls

#### 1. `max-turns` (For Claude/Custom Engines Only)

Limits the number of conversation rounds between the agent and the AI engine.

**Important:** `max-turns` is **only supported by Claude and Custom engines**, not Copilot. For Copilot workflows, use prompt optimization and timeout controls instead.

```yaml
---
# Claude engine with max-turns
engine:
  id: claude
  max-turns: 30  # Recommended for research/analysis workflows
---
```

```yaml
---
# Custom engine with max-turns
engine:
  id: custom
  max-turns: 25  # Recommended for CI/automation workflows
---
```

**How it works:**
- Each "turn" is one round-trip: agent request → AI response
- Includes all tool calls and responses within that turn
- Workflow terminates when max-turns is reached
- Earlier termination if task completes

**Engine Support:**
- ✅ **Claude**: Fully supported
- ✅ **Custom**: Fully supported
- ❌ **Copilot**: Not supported - use prompt optimization instead
- ❌ **Codex**: Not supported

#### 2. `timeout-minutes` (Secondary Control)

Prevents workflows from running indefinitely due to unexpected loops or delays.

```yaml
---
timeout-minutes: 180  # 3 hours - research workflows
timeout-minutes: 45   # 45 minutes - CI cleanup workflows
timeout-minutes: 20   # 20 minutes - single-step automation
---
```

#### 3. Prompt Optimization (Critical for Copilot Workflows)

**Primary method for Copilot token budget control** since max-turns is not available.

Explicit instructions in workflow prompts to reduce token consumption:

**Output Size Limits:**
```markdown
## Output Guidelines

- Keep responses concise and actionable
- Main report should be under 1000 words
- Use progressive disclosure (details/summary tags)
- Summarize findings instead of exhaustive documentation
```

**Scope Reduction:**
```markdown
## Execution Scope

- Test 6-8 representative scenarios (not all scenarios)
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Prioritize critical issues over complete coverage
```

**Efficiency Instructions:**
```markdown
## Efficiency Guidelines

- Avoid verbose explanations - focus on actions
- If stuck after 3 attempts, document and move on
- Complete analysis within reasonable time
- Aim for systematic approach with minimal iteration
```

  - Stop immediately after assignments + comments (or noop)
  - Keep issue comments to the provided template only
  - Read only what is necessary to confirm each issue
  - Do not re-summarize the pre-fetched issue list
  - One tool call per action (assign + comment = 2 calls per issue max)

**Expected Impact:**
- **Token Reduction**: 60-75% (from ~1.99M to ~500K-800K per run)
- **Quality**: Maintained — assignments and comments unchanged
- **Runtime**: Maintained at <5 minutes per run

  - Early exit: if CI is healthy after Phases 1-2, skip to noop
  - PR descriptions capped at 600 words with `<details>` for extended content
  - No duplicate data downloads
  - Stop after PR creation or noop

**Expected Impact:**
- **Token Reduction**: 50-65% (from ~1.78M to ~600K-900K per run)

### Step Name Alignment

**Engine**: Claude - max-turns supported

**Previous Configuration:**
- No max-turns limit
- 30-minute timeout
- Scans all lock files
- No issue-creation cap per run
- Re-reads glossary multiple times

**Optimized Configuration:**
- `max-turns: 30` added to engine block
- `timeout-minutes: 30` (unchanged)
- Added `## Token Budget Guidelines` section in prompt:
  - Report only top 5 most impactful issues per run
  - Create at most 2 GitHub issues per run (batch findings)
  - Load glossary once; do not re-read
  - Skip workflows reviewed in the last 3 days (use cache memory)
  - Early stop after issues created + cache updated

**Expected Impact:**
- **Token Reduction**: 65-80% (from ~1.59M to ~300K-550K per run)
- **Quality**: Maintained — most impactful issues still addressed
- **Runtime**: Reduced from 25-30 minutes to 10-15 minutes

**Budget Target:**
- **Target tokens/run**: 300K–500K
- **Alert threshold**: >800K tokens
- **Cost estimate**: $5.25-8.75 per run

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Hard max-turns limit prevents runaway analysis loops
- Issue-creation cap prevents excessive GitHub API calls
- Cache-based skip logic avoids redundant re-scanning

### Daily Syntax Error Quality Check

**Engine**: Copilot - max-turns not available

**Previous Configuration (2026-04-06 optimization):**
- 20-minute timeout
- Tests 2 workflows with 2 different error categories
- Compact one-line scoring format (no verbose JSON)
- Early stop (noop) when average score ≥ 70 and no individual score < 55
- 235 candidate workflows listed for agent selection → agent often read many to compare complexity
- `cat .github/workflows/*.md` bash permission allowed reading all 235 files
- Verbose per-dimension rubrics (~115 lines) added to every prompt context

**Re-optimized Configuration (2026-04-29):**
- `timeout-minutes: 20` (unchanged)
- **Pre-select 5 random candidates** in the pre-step (`shuf -n 5`) — agent only sees 5 choices instead of 235
- **Removed `cat .github/workflows/*.md` bash permission** — agent can only preview with `head -n 30`
- **Removed `find` and `head -n *` bash permissions** — prevents unbounded file reads
- Lowered early-stop threshold: ≥ 70 → **≥ 65** (fires more often, skipping issue generation)
- Lowered individual score floor: < 55 → **< 50**
- Condensed verbose scoring rubric to a single compact table (~15 lines vs ~115 lines)
- Turn target enforced: **≤ 20 turns** (was accidentally set to 30)

**Expected Impact:**
- **Token Reduction**: 90-95% vs the 6M run; 50-70% vs the 2026-04-06 baseline
- **Quality**: Maintained — compiler error quality still evaluated across all 5 dimensions
- **Runtime**: ≤ 20 turns; most runs end with noop when scores ≥ 65

**Budget Target:**
- **Target tokens/run**: 150K–400K (typical, early-stop); up to 1.5M (issue-creating run)
- **Alert threshold**: >2M tokens
- **Cost estimate**: $2.63-7.00 per run (typical)

### Dead Code Remover

**Engine**: Copilot - max-turns not available

**Previous Configuration:**
- No token budget controls
- 30-minute timeout
- Batch of up to 10 functions per run
- Unlimited grep output for caller checks
- Full test output captured per run

**Optimized Configuration:**
- `timeout-minutes: 30` (unchanged)
- Added `## Token Budget Guidelines` section in prompt:
  - Reduce batch from 10 to 5 functions per run
  - Limit grep output to 5 matches (`grep -m 5`) per safety check
  - Limit test output to last 20 lines (`tail -20`)
  - Immediate noop (after Phase 2) if deadcode finds 0 unprocessed functions
  - No re-read of full cache before appending

**Expected Impact:**
- **Token Reduction**: 45-55% (from ~9.1M to ~4M-5M per run)
- **Quality**: Maintained — safety checks unchanged, build verification still required
- **Runtime**: Reduced processing turns

**Budget Target:**
- **Target tokens/run**: 4M–5M
- **Alert threshold**: >7M tokens
- **Cost estimate**: $70-87.50 per run

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Half the batch size → half the safety checks, edits, and build iterations
- Truncated grep output → avoids large result dumps increasing context
- Truncated test output → avoids multi-MB test logs inflating token count
- Early-stop condition (Phase 2) → skips all phases when nothing new to process

### Daily Community Attribution Updater

**Engine**: Copilot (claude-haiku-4.5) - max-turns not available

**Previous Configuration (runaway — 2026-04-30):**
- No token budget controls
- 30-minute timeout
- Unbounded Tier 3 candidate lookups (one `issue_read` per issue, up to hundreds)
- No early-stop after PR creation / noop
- README.md not pre-fetched (agent spent extra turns locating it)
- 159 turns, 8.7M tokens, 35.6% firewall block rate (88/247)

**Optimized Configuration (2026-04-30):**
- `timeout-minutes: 20` (reduced from 30)
- Tier 3 candidates capped at **5 per run** in the bash pre-step
- `README.md` pre-copied to `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/community-data/README_current.md`
- Added `## Token Budget Guidelines` section in prompt:
  - Read each data file at most once
  - At most 1 `issue_read` call per Tier 3 candidate
  - Stop immediately after `create_pull_request` or `noop`
  - PR body capped at 400 words
  - No direct external HTTP calls

**Expected Impact:**
- **Token Reduction**: 90-95% (from ~8.7M to ~200K-600K per run)
- **Quality**: Maintained — Tier 3 deferred items processed in subsequent daily runs
- **Firewall blocks**: Eliminated — agent no longer loops retrying blocked calls

**Budget Target:**
- **Target tokens/run**: 200K–600K
- **Alert threshold**: >1.5M tokens
- **Cost estimate**: $3.50-10.50 per run

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Reduce Iteration Scope

**Before:**
```markdown
For each scenario (15-20 scenarios), test the agent response...
```

**After:**
```markdown
Test a representative subset of 6-8 scenarios to reduce token consumption...
```

**Impact**: 40-60% reduction in Phase 3 token usage

### 2. Output Compression

**Before:**
```markdown
### Detailed Analysis
[5000 word detailed report with all scenario details]
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Key Findings (3-5 bullet points max)
<details>
<summary>View Detailed Scenario Analysis</summary>
[Detailed content hidden by default]
</details>
```

**Impact**: 30-40% reduction in documentation generation tokens

### 3. Early Termination Conditions

**Before:**
```markdown
Work through each step systematically.
```

**After:**
```markdown
If all checks pass, stop immediately and create PR.
If stuck on an issue after 3 attempts, document it and move on.
```

**Impact**: 10-20% reduction by avoiding stuck states

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

Use HTML `<details>` tags to reduce initial output verbosity:

```markdown
<details>
<summary>View Detailed Examples</summary>

[Verbose content that AI generates once but doesn't repeatedly reference]

</details>
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Recommended Metrics

1. **Tokens per Run**: Track actual token consumption per workflow execution
2. **Cost per Run**: Calculate estimated cost based on token usage
3. **Budget Compliance**: % of runs within target budget
4. **Quality Metrics**: Ensure optimization doesn't degrade output quality

### Alert Thresholds

See the **Alert Thresholds (Updated)** table in the [Workflow-Specific Budgets](#workflow-specific-budgets) section above for all workflows including Issue Monster, CI Optimization Coach, and Step Name Alignment.

### Monitoring Tools

Use the daily Copilot token report workflow:
- Location: `.github/workflows/daily-copilot-token-report.md`
- Generates per-workflow statistics
- Tracks historical trends
- Identifies cost anomalies

## Implementation Checklist

When adding token budgets to a workflow:

- [ ] Set `max-turns` based on workflow complexity
- [ ] Adjust `timeout-minutes` to reasonable completion time
- [ ] Add output size limits in prompt instructions
- [ ] Add efficiency guidelines for agent behavior
- [ ] Document budget targets in workflow comments
- [ ] Consider scope reduction opportunities
- [ ] Add early termination conditions
- [ ] Test to verify budget compliance
- [ ] Monitor actual token consumption
- [ ] Adjust thresholds based on real-world data

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Set `max-turns` for all production workflows
- ✅ Document budget targets in workflow frontmatter comments
- ✅ Use progressive disclosure for verbose outputs
- ✅ Provide explicit output size limits
- ✅ Add early termination conditions
- ✅ Monitor token consumption trends
- ✅ Test workflows to verify budget compliance

### DON'T:
- ❌ Set max-turns so low that workflows can't complete
- ❌ Sacrifice quality for marginal token savings
- ❌ Ignore budget exceedances without investigation
- ❌ Over-optimize prompts to the point of confusion
- ❌ Remove important analysis steps without validation
- ❌ Deploy budget changes without testing
