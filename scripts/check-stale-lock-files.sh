# check-stale-lock-files.sh - Lightweight guard for stale .lock.yml files
#
# Detects workflow .md files that changed without their compiled .lock.yml being
# regenerated.
#
# Unlike check-workflow-drift.sh, this script does not require the gh-aw binary:
# it uses git to identify modified .md files and checks whether each has a
# corresponding .lock.yml that was also modified.  Use check-workflow-drift.sh
# for a thorough recompile-based verification; use this script as a fast early
# gate that catches the obvious case where a .md was edited and not recompiled.
#
# By default, the script inspects staged/unstaged changes in the current working
# tree. With --base-ref, it instead compares HEAD to a base ref, which is useful
# for CI runs on a clean checkout.
#
# Usage:
#   check-stale-lock-files.sh [--dir <workflows-dir>] [--base-ref <git-ref>]
#
# Options:
#   --dir <dir>   Workflows directory to scan (default: .github/workflows).
#                 The script only examines .md files under this directory.
#   --base-ref <git-ref>
#                 Git base ref used to detect changed files via
#                 `git diff <base-ref>...HEAD`. Intended for CI.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - No modified .md files detected, or every modified .md has a
#       correspondingly modified .lock.yml
#   1 - One or more modified .md files lack an up-to-date .lock.yml
