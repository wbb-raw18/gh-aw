# check-workflow-drift.sh - Detect drift between workflow markdown sources and generated lock files
#
# Compiles all .github/workflows/*.md files and then checks whether the resulting
# .lock.yml files match what is already on disk.  Exits non-zero and prints a clear
# remediation message if any drift is detected.
#
# Usage:
#   check-workflow-drift.sh <path-to-binary>
#
# Arguments:
#   <path-to-binary>  Path to the gh-aw binary.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Lock files are up to date with their markdown sources
#   1 - Drift detected (lock files need to be regenerated)
