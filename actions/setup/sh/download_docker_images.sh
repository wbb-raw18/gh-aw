# Download Docker images with retry logic and controlled parallelism
# Usage: download_docker_images.sh IMAGE1 [IMAGE2 ...]
#
# This script downloads multiple Docker images in parallel with controlled
# parallelism (max 4 concurrent downloads) to improve performance without
# overwhelming the system. Docker daemon supports concurrent pulls, which can
# provide significant speedup when downloading multiple images.
#
# Each image is pulled with retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff).
# The script fails if any image fails to download after all retry attempts.
#
# When images include a digest pin (e.g. image:tag@sha256:abc), the script
# ensures the tag alias (image:tag) is created after pulling so that tools
# referencing images by tag (such as AWF with --skip-pull) can find them.
#
# The script also aliases the image as "image:latest" so that any downstream
# tool that references the image via the mutable ":latest" tag (regardless of
# which versioned tag was actually pulled) can still resolve it locally under
# --pull-never/--skip-pull semantics. This guards against tag mismatches
# between the version-pinned tag written here and a ":latest" reference used
# elsewhere (see gh-aw#50681).
