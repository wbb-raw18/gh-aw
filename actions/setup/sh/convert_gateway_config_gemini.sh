# Convert MCP Gateway Configuration to Gemini Format
# This script converts the gateway's standard HTTP-based MCP configuration
# to the JSON format expected by Gemini CLI (.gemini/settings.json)
#
# Gemini CLI reads MCP server configuration from settings.json files:
# - Global: ~/.gemini/settings.json
# - Project: .gemini/settings.json (used here)
#
# See: https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/

# This prevents the race window between file creation via output redirection and
# a subsequent chmod, which would leave credential-bearing files world-readable
# (mode 0644) with a typical umask of 022.

# Convert gateway output to Gemini settings.json format
# Gateway format:
# {
#   "mcpServers": {
#     "server-name": {
#       "type": "http",
#       "url": "http://domain:port/mcp/server-name",
#       "headers": {
#         "Authorization": "apiKey"
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# Gemini settings.json format:
# {
#   "mcpServers": {
#     "server-name": {
#       "url": "http://domain:port/mcp/server-name",
#       "headers": {
#         "Authorization": "apiKey"
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# The main differences:
# 1. Remove "type" field (Gemini uses transport auto-detection from url/httpUrl)
# 2. The "tools" field is preserved from the gateway config to enforce the tool allowlist
#    at the gateway layer (not removed, unlike older versions that treated it as Copilot-specific)
# 3. URLs must use MCP_GATEWAY_HOST_DOMAIN since Gemini runs on the host runner.
#    Under normal conditions this is "localhost". Under network isolation it is the
#    topology hostname (e.g. "awmg-mcpg") because Gemini honors HTTP_PROXY but ignores
#    NO_PROXY, so a localhost URL would be tunneled through the egress proxy and denied.
#    The topology hostname is already in the firewall allowlist via auto-allow-topology-hostnames.

# Build the correct URL prefix using the host-side domain and port.
# Gemini CLI runs directly on the host runner (not inside a Docker container), so use
# MCP_GATEWAY_HOST_DOMAIN instead of MCP_GATEWAY_DOMAIN (host.docker.internal).
# host.docker.internal does not resolve on the host runner on Linux.
# Under network isolation, MCP_GATEWAY_HOST_DOMAIN is set to the topology hostname
# (awmg-mcpg) rather than localhost — see writeMCPGatewayExports in mcp_setup_gateway.go.
