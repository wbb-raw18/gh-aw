# print_firewall_logs.sh - Reclaim firewall sandbox dir ownership and print AWF firewall log summary.
#
# Usage: bash print_firewall_logs.sh [--rootless]
#
# Options:
#   --rootless   Use non-interactive sudo (sudo -n) with a non-sudo chmod fallback.
#                Default: use plain sudo (AWF ran with full sudo access).
#
# Environment:
#   AWF_LOGS_DIR         Path to the AWF logs directory (must be set).
#                        The Go compiler (engine_firewall_support.go) sets this to
#                        "${RUNNER_TEMP}/gh-aw/sandbox/firewall/logs"; the parent
#                        directory (firewall sandbox root) is used for chown/chmod.
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY  Path to the GitHub Actions step summary file.
#                        If unset or empty, log output is printed to stdout only.
