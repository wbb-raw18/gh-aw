#
# macOS GHA runners (macos-latest / macos-15-arm64) do not include Docker.
# This script installs colima (a lightweight Docker runtime for macOS) and the
# Docker CLI via Homebrew, then starts colima with Apple's Virtualization
# framework (vz) for native ARM64 performance.
#
# On Linux runners, Docker is pre-installed so this script exits early.
