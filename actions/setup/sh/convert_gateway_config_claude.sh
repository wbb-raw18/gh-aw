# Convert gateway output to Claude format
# Gateway format:
# {
#   "mcpServers": {
#     "server-name": {
#       "type": "http",
#       "url": "http://domain:port/mcp/server-name",
#       "headers": {
#         "Authorization": "apiKey"
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# Claude format (JSON with HTTP type and headers):
# {
#   "mcpServers": {
#     "server-name": {
#       "type": "http",
#       "url": "http://domain:port/mcp/server-name",
#       "headers": {
#         "Authorization": "apiKey"
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# The main differences:
# 1. Claude uses "type": "http" for HTTP-based MCP servers
# 2. The "tools" field is preserved from the gateway config to enforce the tool allowlist
#    at the gateway layer (not removed, unlike older versions that treated it as Copilot-specific)
# 3. URLs must use the correct domain (host.docker.internal) for container access

# Build the correct URL prefix using the configured domain and port
URL_PREFIX="http://${MCP_GATEWAY_DOMAIN}:${MCP_GATEWAY_PORT}"
