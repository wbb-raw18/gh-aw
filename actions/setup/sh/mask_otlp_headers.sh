# mask_otlp_headers.sh - Mask OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS from GitHub Actions logs
#
# Issues the ::add-mask:: workflow command for OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS so that
# authentication tokens in the header value do not leak into GitHub Actions runner
# logs (including debug/step-debug logs).
#
# When GH_AW_OTLP_ALL_HEADERS is set (multi-endpoint configuration), the same
# masking is applied to all endpoint headers combined in that variable.
#
# Up to three levels of masking are applied to each headers string:
#   1. The entire comma-separated header pairs string.
#   2. Each individual header value extracted from the pairs, so that a token
#      appearing without its header name prefix is also redacted.
#   3. For Authorization-style "Bearer <token>" credentials, the raw token after
#      stripping the "Bearer " scheme prefix, so it is masked even when it appears
#      without the scheme (e.g. in downstream tool logs).
# Values shorter than MIN_MASK_LENGTH are skipped at all levels.
#
# Mixed quoting ('::add-mask::' followed by "$VAR") is used so the directive prefix
# is treated as a literal string while the variable values are expanded at runtime.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Success (variables may be empty, which is a no-op)
