# Reclaim stale root-owned /tmp/gh-aw/sandbox/firewall before creating it fresh.
# A previous AWF run can leave this directory (or its subdirectories) owned by root
# (Docker containers run as root, e.g. Squid runs as UID 13 inside a container, writing
# files to the host-mounted volume).
# setup.sh removes the entire /tmp/gh-aw tree using sudo, but if that cleanup partially
# failed (e.g. sudo was unavailable), the stale directory persists here.
# This targeted cleanup is defense-in-depth: it removes the specific directory tree that
# AWF's writeConfigs step will try to populate, so AWF can always create it fresh as the
# runner user.
# Note: the writability check covers both the firewall root AND its subdirectories (logs/,
# audit/) because Docker/Squid may own only the subdirectories when the parent was
# pre-created by the runner user on a prior clean run.
