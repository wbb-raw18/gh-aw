## Repo Memory Locations Available

You have access to persistent repo memory folders where you can read and write files that are stored in git branches:

__GH_AW_MEMORY_LIST__
- **Read/Write Access**: You can freely read from and write to any files in these folders
- **Git Branch Storage**: Each memory is stored in its own git branch
- **Automatic Push**: Changes are automatically committed and pushed after the workflow completes
- **Merge Strategy**: In case of conflicts, your changes (current version) win
- **Persistence**: Files persist across workflow runs via git branch storage
- **Allowed File Types**: Only the following file extensions are allowed: `__GH_AW_MEMORY_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS__`. Files with other extensions will be rejected during validation.

Examples of what you can store:
- `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/notes.md` - general notes and observations
- `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/notes.txt` - plain text notes
- `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/state.json` - structured state data
- `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/history.jsonl` - activity history in JSON Lines format
- `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/data.csv` - tabular data
- `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/history/` - organized history files (with allowed file types)

Feel free to create, read, update, and organize files in these folders as needed for your tasks, using only the allowed file types.

**Important**: After writing or updating memory files, if the `push_repo_memory` tool is available, call it (with the appropriate `memory_id`) to validate that the total memory size is within the configured limits. If the tool returns an error, reduce the size of your memory files (e.g., summarize notes, remove outdated entries) and try again before completing your task.
