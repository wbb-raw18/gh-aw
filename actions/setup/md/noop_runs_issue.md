This issue tracks all no-op runs from agentic workflows in this repository. Each workflow run that completes with a no-op message (indicating no action was needed) posts a comment here.

<details>
<summary>What is a No-Op?</summary>

A no-op (no operation) occurs when an agentic workflow runs successfully but determines that no action is required. For example:
- A security scanner that finds no issues
- An update checker that finds nothing to update
- A monitoring workflow that finds everything is healthy

These are successful outcomes, not failures, and help provide transparency into workflow behavior.

<details>
<summary>How This Helps</summary>

This issue helps you:
- Track workflows that ran but determined no action was needed
- Distinguish between failures and intentional no-ops
- Monitor workflow health by seeing when workflows decide not to act

<summary>How to disable no-op reporting for a workflow</summary>

To stop a workflow from posting here, set `report-as-issue: false` in its frontmatter:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  noop:
    report-as-issue: false
```
