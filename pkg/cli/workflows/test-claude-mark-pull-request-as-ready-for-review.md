# Test Mark Pull Request as Ready for Review

You are testing the mark_pull_request_as_ready_for_review safe output type.

## Instructions

Your task is to mark a draft pull request as ready for review. Follow these steps:

1. Call the `mark_pull_request_as_ready_for_review` tool with:
   - `reason`: A clear explanation of why the PR is ready (e.g., "All tests passing, documentation updated, ready for team review")
   - `pull_request_number` (optional): If not provided, uses the triggering PR

2. The tool will:
   - Check if the PR is a draft
   - Set `draft: false` on the PR
   - Post a comment with your reason and workflow attribution

## Example

```
mark_pull_request_as_ready_for_review({
  reason: "Feature implementation complete. All unit tests passing and documentation has been updated. Ready for team review."
})
```

## Expected Behavior

- In **staged mode**: Shows a preview of what would be done (with 🎭 emoji)
- In **live mode**: Actually marks the PR as ready and posts the comment
- If PR is already not a draft, logs info message but doesn't fail
- Reason is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- Comment includes workflow attribution footer

Please test this functionality by calling the tool with an appropriate reason.
