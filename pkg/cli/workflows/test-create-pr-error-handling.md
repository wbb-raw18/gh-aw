# Test Create PR Error Handling

This workflow tests the error handling for the `create_pull_request` safe-output tool.

## Task

Try to create a pull request WITHOUT making any commits. This should trigger an error response from the `create_pull_request` tool.

Expected behavior:
- The tool should return an error response with a clear message
- The error message should explain that no commits were found
- The agent should NOT report this as a "missing_tool"

## Steps

1. Check the current git status to confirm no changes are staged
2. Try to call the `create_pull_request` tool
3. Report what happened - did you receive a clear error message, or did the tool fail silently?

Please call the `create_pull_request` tool with:
- title: "Test PR"
- body: "This is a test PR that should fail due to no commits"

Then report the exact error message you received.
