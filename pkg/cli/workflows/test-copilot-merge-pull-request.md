# Test Copilot Merge Pull Request

Test the `merge_pull_request` safe output type with the Copilot engine.

## Task

Merge pull request #1 using the "squash" merge method with:
- commit_title: "Test: Squash merge via automated workflow"
- commit_message: "This pull request was merged automatically by the Copilot test workflow to verify the merge_pull_request safe output type."

Output results in JSONL format using the `merge_pull_request` tool.
