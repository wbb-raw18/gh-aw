# Test Service Ports

This workflow tests that the compiler generates `--allow-host-service-ports`
from `services:` port mappings when `runtime: docker-sudo-iptables` opts AWF into
host-access mode.

Expected: the compiled lock file includes `--allow-host-service-ports` with expressions for
both PostgreSQL (port 5432) and Redis (port 6379).
