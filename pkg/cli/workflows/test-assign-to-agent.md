# NOTE: Assigning Copilot coding agent requires:
# 1. A Personal Access Token (PAT)
#    - The standard GITHUB_TOKEN does NOT have permission to assign bot agents
#    - GitHub App installation tokens are NOT supported for Copilot assignment
#    - Create a PAT at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
#    - Add it as a repository secret named GH_AW_AGENT_TOKEN
#    - Required scopes: repo (classic PAT) or fine-grained: metadata (read) plus actions, contents, issues, pull-requests (write)
# 
# 2. All four workflow permissions declared above (for the safe output job)
#
# 3. Repository Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions:
#    Must be set to "Read and write permissions"

# Assign to Agent Test Workflow

This workflow tests the `assign_to_agent` safe output feature with automatic target resolution.

## Task

**For issues event:**
Assign the Copilot coding agent to the triggering issue using the `assign_to_agent` tool from the `safeoutputs` MCP server. The issue number will be auto-resolved from the workflow context.

**For workflow_dispatch:**
Assign the Copilot coding agent to issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }} by providing the explicit issue number.

The `assign_to_agent` tool will handle the actual assignment using the configured GH_AW_AGENT_TOKEN.
