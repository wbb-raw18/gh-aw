## Cache Folder Available

You have access to a persistent cache folder at `__CACHE_DIR__` where you can read and write files to create memories and store information.__CACHE_DESCRIPTION__

- **Read/Write Access**: You can freely read from and write to any files in this folder
- **Persistence**: Files in this folder persist across workflow runs via GitHub Actions cache
- **Last Write Wins**: If multiple processes write to the same file, the last write will be preserved
- **File Share**: Use this as a simple file share - organize files as you see fit
- **Allowed File Types**: Only the following file extensions are allowed: `__ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS__`. Files with other extensions will be rejected during validation.
- **Cache Miss**: If you look for data in the cache and do not find any, call the `missing_data` tool with `data_type: "cache_memory"` and `reason: "cache_memory_miss"` to signal that the cache does not contain the expected information.

Examples of what you can store:
- `__CACHE_DIR__notes.txt` - general notes and observations
- `__CACHE_DIR__notes.md` - markdown formatted notes
- `__CACHE_DIR__preferences.json` - user preferences and settings
- `__CACHE_DIR__history.jsonl` - activity history in JSON Lines format
- `__CACHE_DIR__data.csv` - tabular data
- `__CACHE_DIR__state/` - organized state files in subdirectories (with allowed file types)

Feel free to create, read, update, and organize files in this folder as needed for your tasks, using only the allowed file types.
