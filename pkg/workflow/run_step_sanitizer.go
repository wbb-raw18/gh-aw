// This file provides automatic sanitization of GitHub Actions expressions in run: steps.
//
// # Shell Injection Prevention
//
// When a workflow step's run: field contains GitHub Actions expressions like
// ${{ github.event.issue.title }} or ${{ steps.foo.outputs.bar }}, an attacker
// who controls those values can inject arbitrary shell commands — a technique known
// as template injection or script injection.
//
// The safe pattern is to bind the expression to an environment variable in the
// step's env: block and then reference the variable as $VAR_NAME in the shell
// script.  The environment variable assignment is handled by the GitHub Actions
// runner and the value is treated as data, not code.
//
// # What this file does
//
// sanitizeRunStepExpressions inspects a step map and, for every ${{ ... }}
// expression that appears directly in the run: field (outside of heredoc blocks),
// it:
//   1. Generates a deterministic GH_AW_ environment variable name for the expression.
//   2. Adds the expression as a value under env: for that step.
//   3. Replaces the inline ${{ ... }} occurrence in the run: script with the
//      corresponding $GH_AW_... shell variable reference.
//
// The function returns the sanitized step map, a slice of human-readable
// descriptions of every substitution made (one entry per unique expression), and
// a boolean indicating whether any changes were made.
//
// sanitizeCustomStepsYAML applies the same logic to a raw "steps:" YAML string as
// produced by the frontmatter parser, re-serialising each modified step back to YAML.
//
// # Warning behaviour
//
// Callers are expected to emit one compiler warning per unique expression that was
// extracted, describing what was changed and why, so that workflow authors are aware
// that their shell script was modified by the compiler.
//
// # Edge cases
//
// Heredoc blocks (e.g. << 'EOF' ... EOF) are intentionally excluded from
// extraction because their content is written to a file or stdin and is not
// executed by the shell interpreter as code.  The existing removeHeredocContent
// helper from template_injection_utils.go is reused for this detection.
