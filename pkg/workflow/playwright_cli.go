package workflow

// Package workflow provides support for Playwright CLI mode.
//
// # Playwright CLI Mode
//
// When tools.playwright is enabled, the compiler installs the @playwright/cli
// npm package. CLI is the only built-in Playwright integration.
// This is a token-efficient alternative for coding agents that prefer CLI-based
// workflows over MCP: CLI invocations avoid loading large tool schemas and verbose
// accessibility trees into the model context.
//
// See https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli for details.
//
// In CLI mode:
//   - @playwright/cli is installed via npm (global) before the agent runs.
//   - playwright-cli install --skills installs agent skill files so the coding
//     agent can discover and use the available playwright-cli commands.
//   - The agent uses `playwright-cli <command>` directly via bash.
//
// Example workflow frontmatter:
//
//	tools:
//	  playwright:
