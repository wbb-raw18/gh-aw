*Ooh!* Time to plunge into the *data wonderland* at [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/)! Where numbers dance and patterns sing!

In our [previous post](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows-organization/), we explored organization and cross-repo workflows that operate at enterprise scale - analyzing dozens of repositories together to find patterns and outliers that single-repo analysis would miss. We learned that perspective matters: what looks normal in isolation might signal drift at scale.

Beyond tracking basic metrics (run time, cost, success rate), we wanted deeper insights into *how* our agents actually behave and *how* developers interact with them. What patterns emerge from thousands of agent prompts? What makes some PR conversations more effective than others? How do usage patterns reveal improvement opportunities? This is where we brought out the big guns: machine learning, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and clustering algorithms. Advanced analytics workflows don't just count things - they understand them, finding patterns and insights that direct observation would never reveal.

## Advanced Analytics & ML Workflows

These agents use sophisticated analysis techniques to extract insights:

- **[Copilot Session Insights](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/copilot-session-insights.md?plain=1)** - Analyzes Copilot coding agent usage patterns and metrics - **32 analysis discussions**  
- **[Copilot PR NLP Analysis](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/copilot-pr-nlp-analysis.md?plain=1)** - Natural language processing on PR conversations  
- **[Prompt Clustering Analysis](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/prompt-clustering-analysis.md?plain=1)** - Clusters and categorizes agent prompts using ML - **27 analysis discussions**  
- **[Copilot Agent Analysis](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/copilot-agent-analysis.md?plain=1)** - Deep analysis of agent behavior patterns - **48 daily analysis discussions**  

Prompt Clustering Analysis has created **27 analysis discussions** using ML to categorize thousands of agent prompts - for example, [#6918](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/discussions/6918) clustering agent prompts to identify patterns and optimization opportunities. It revealed patterns we never noticed ("oh, 40% of our prompts are about error handling").

Copilot PR NLP Analysis applies natural language processing to PR conversations, performing sentiment analysis and identifying linguistic patterns across agent interactions. It found that PRs with questions in the title get faster review.

Copilot Session Insights has created **32 analysis discussions** examining Copilot coding agent usage patterns and metrics across the workflow ecosystem. It identifies common patterns and failure modes.

Copilot Coding Agent Analysis has created **48 daily analysis discussions** providing deep analysis of agent behavior patterns - for example, [#6913](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/discussions/6913) with the daily Copilot coding agent analysis.

What we learned: **meta-analysis is powerful** - using AI to analyze AI systems reveals insights that direct observation misses. These workflows helped us understand not just what our agents do, but *how* they behave and how users interact with them.

## Using These Workflows

You can add these workflows to your own repository and remix it as follows:

**Copilot Session Insights:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/copilot-agent-analysis.md
```

**Copilot PR NLP Analysis:**
 
```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/copilot-pr-nlp-analysis
```

**Prompt Clustering Analysis:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/prompt-clustering-analysis.md
```

**Copilot Agent Analysis:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/copilot-agent-analysis.md
```

Then edit and remix the workflow specifications to meet your needs, regenerate the lock file using `gh aw compile`, and push to your repository. See our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) for further installation and setup instructions.

You can also [create your own workflows](/gh-aw/setup/creating-workflows/).

## Next Up: Project Coordination Workflows

We've reached the final stop: coordinating multiple agents toward shared, complex goals across extended timelines.
