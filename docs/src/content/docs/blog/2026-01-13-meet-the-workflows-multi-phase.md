Let's continue our journey through [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/)!

In our [previous post](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows-tool-infrastructure/), we explored infrastructure workflows - the meta-monitoring layer that validates MCP servers, checks tool configurations, and ensures the platform itself stays healthy. These workflows watch the watchers, providing visibility into the invisible plumbing.

Most workflows we've seen so far run once and complete: analyze this PR, triage that issue, test this deployment. They're ephemeral - they execute, produce results, and disappear. But what about projects that are too big to tackle in a single run? What about initiatives that require research, setup, and incremental implementation? Traditional CI/CD is built for stateless execution, but we discovered something powerful: workflows that maintain state across days, working a little bit each day like a persistent team member who never takes breaks. Welcome to our most ambitious experiment - multi-phase improvers that prove AI agents can handle complex, long-running projects.

## Multi-Phase Improver Workflows

These are some of our most ambitious agents - they tackle big projects over multiple days:

- **[Daily Backlog Burner](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-backlog-burner.md?plain=1)** - Systematically works through issues and PRs, one day at a time
- **[Daily Perf Improver](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-perf-improver.md?plain=1)** - Three-phase performance optimization (research, setup, implement)
- **[Daily QA](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-qa.md?plain=1)** - Continuous quality assurance that never sleeps
- **[Daily Accessibility Review](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-accessibility-review.md?plain=1)** - WCAG compliance checking with Playwright
- **[PR Fix](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/pr-fix.md?plain=1)** - On-demand slash command to fix failing CI checks (super handy!)

This is where we got experimental with agent persistence and multi-day workflows. Traditional CI runs are ephemeral, but these workflows maintain state across days using repo-memory. The Daily Perf Improver runs in three phases - research (find bottlenecks), setup (create profiling infrastructure), implement (optimize). It's like having a performance engineer who works a little bit each day. The Daily Backlog Burner systematically tackles our issue backlog - one issue per day, methodically working through technical debt. We learned that **incremental progress beats heroic sprints** - these agents never get tired, never get distracted, and never need coffee breaks. The PR Fix workflow is our emergency responder - when CI fails, invoke `/pr-fix` and it investigates and attempts repairs.

These workflows prove that AI agents can handle complex, long-running projects when given the right architecture.

## Using These Workflows

You can add these workflows to your own repository and remix them. Get going with our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/), then run one of the following:

**Daily Backlog Burner:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/workflows/daily-backlog-burner.md
```

**Daily Perf Improver:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/workflows/daily-perf-improver.md
```

**Daily QA:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/workflows/daily-qa.md
```

**Daily Accessibility Review:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/workflows/daily-accessibility-review.md
```

**PR Fix:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/workflows/pr-fix.md
```

Then edit and remix the workflow specifications to meet your needs, regenerate the lock file using `gh aw compile`, and push to your repository. See our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) for further installation and setup instructions.

You can also [create your own workflows](/gh-aw/setup/creating-workflows/).

## Next Up: Organization & Cross-Repo Workflows

Single-repository workflows are powerful, but what happens when you scale to an entire organization with dozens of repositories?
