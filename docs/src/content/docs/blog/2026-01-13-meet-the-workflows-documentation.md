Step right up, step right up, and enter the *documentation chamber* of [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/)! Pure imagination meets technical accuracy in this most delightful corner of our establishment!

In our [previous posts](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows-continuous-simplicity/), we explored autonomous cleanup agents - workflows that continuously improve code quality by simplifying complexity, refactoring structure, polishing style, and maintaining overall repository health. These agents never take a day off, quietly working to make our codebase better.

Now let's address one of software development's eternal challenges: keeping documentation accurate and up-to-date. Code evolves rapidly; docs... not so much. Terminology drifts, API examples become outdated, slide decks grow stale, and blog posts reference deprecated features. The question isn't "can AI agents write good documentation?" but rather "can they maintain it as code changes?" Documentation and content workflows challenge conventional wisdom about AI-generated technical content. Spoiler: the answer involves human review, but it's way better than the alternative (no docs at all).

## Continuous Documentation Workflows

These agents maintain high-quality documentation and content:

- **[Daily Documentation Updater](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-doc-updater.md?plain=1)** - Reviews and updates documentation to ensure accuracy and completeness - **57 merged PRs out of 59 proposed (96% merge rate)**  
- **[Glossary Maintainer](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/glossary-maintainer.md?plain=1)** - Keeps glossary synchronized with codebase - **10 merged PRs out of 10 proposed (100% merge rate)**  
- **[Documentation Unbloat](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/unbloat-docs.md?plain=1)** - Reviews and simplifies documentation by reducing verbosity - **88 merged PRs out of 103 proposed (85% merge rate)**  
- **[Documentation Noob Tester](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs-noob-tester.md?plain=1)** - Tests documentation as a new user would, identifying confusing steps - **9 merged PRs (43% merge rate)** via causal chain  
- **[Slide Deck Maintainer](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/slide-deck-maintainer.md?plain=1)** - Maintains presentation slide decks - **2 merged PRs out of 5 proposed (40% merge rate)**  
- **[Multi-device Docs Tester](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-multi-device-docs-tester.md?plain=1)** - Tests documentation site across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices - **2 merged PRs out of 2 proposed (100% merge rate)**  
- **[Blog Auditor](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/blog-auditor.md?plain=1)** - Verifies blog posts are accessible and contain expected content - **6 audits completed** (5 passed, 1 flagged issues)  
  
Documentation is where we challenged conventional wisdom. Can AI agents write *good* documentation?

The **Technical Doc Writer** generates API docs from code, but more importantly, it *maintains* them - updating docs when code changes. The Glossary Maintainer caught terminology drift ("we're using three different terms for the same concept").

The **Slide Deck Maintainer** keeps our presentation materials current without manual updates.

The **Multi-device Docs Tester** uses Playwright to verify our documentation site works across phones, tablets, and desktops - testing responsive layouts, accessibility, and interactive elements. It catches visual regressions and layout issues that only appear on specific screen sizes.

The **Blog Auditor** ensures our blog posts stay accurate as the codebase evolves - it flags outdated code examples and broken links. Blog Auditor is a **validation-only workflow** that creates audit reports rather than code changes. It has run **6 audits** (5 passed, [1 flagged out-of-date content](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/issues/2162)), confirming blog accuracy.

Documentation Noob Tester deserves special mention for its exploratory nature. It has produced **9 merged PRs out of 21 proposed (43% merge rate)** through a causal chain: 62 discussions analyzed → 21 issues created → 21 PRs. The lower merge rate reflects this workflow's exploratory nature - it identifies many potential improvements, some of which are too ambitious for immediate implementation. For example, [Discussion #8477](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/discussions/8477) led to [Issue #8486](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/issues/8486) which spawned PRs [#8716](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/8716) and [#8717](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/8717), both merged.

AI-generated docs need human/agent review, but they're dramatically better than *no* docs (which is often the alternative). Validation can be automated to a large extent, freeing writers to focus on content shaping, topic, clarity, tone, and accuracy.

In this collection of agents, we took a heterogeneous approach - some workflows generate content, others maintain it, and still others validate it. Other approaches are possible - all tasks can be rolled into a single agent. We found that it's easier to explore the space by using multiple agents, to separate concerns, and that encouraged us to use agents for other communication outputs such as blogs and slides.

## Using These Workflows

You can add these workflows to your own repository and remix them. Get going with our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/), then run one of the following:

**Daily Documentation Updater:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-doc-updater.md
```

**Glossary Maintainer:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/glossary-maintainer.md
```

**Documentation Unbloat:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/unbloat-docs.md
```

**Documentation Noob Tester:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs-noob-tester.md
```

**Slide Deck Maintainer:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/slide-deck-maintainer.md
```

**Multi-device Docs Tester:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-multi-device-docs-tester.md
```

**Blog Auditor:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/blog-auditor.md
```

Then edit and remix the workflow specifications to meet your needs, regenerate the lock file using `gh aw compile`, and push to your repository. See our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) for further installation and setup instructions.

You can also [create your own workflows](/gh-aw/setup/creating-workflows/).

## Next Up: Issue & PR Management Workflows

Beyond writing code and docs, we need to manage the flow of issues and pull requests. How do we keep collaboration smooth and efficient?
