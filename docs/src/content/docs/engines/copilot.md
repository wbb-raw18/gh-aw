title: Using GitHub Copilot with GitHub Agentic Workflows
description: Select and authenticate GitHub Copilot as the AI engine for GitHub Agentic Workflows, understand its capabilities and limitations, and start from an example.
---

[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) is a coding agent from GitHub and the default AI engine for GitHub Agentic Workflows. GitHub Agentic Workflows runs Copilot CLI in GitHub Actions, adding GitHub event triggers and guardrails.

## Selecting GitHub Copilot as the AI engine

GitHub Copilot is the default AI engine used by GitHub Agentic Workflows. To select it explicitly, add this to the workflow frontmatter:

```yaml
engine: copilot
```

To authenticate:
- For organization-billed usage, grant [`copilot-requests: write`](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#copilot-requests-write-permission).
- Otherwise, to authenticate with a GitHub Copilot subscription, provide a [`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#copilot_github_token) secret containing a fine-grained PAT with Copilot Requests access.

## Example: scheduled repository report

```aw wrap title=".github/workflows/daily-status.md"
---
on:
  schedule: daily

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read
  copilot-requests: write

engine: copilot

safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[status] "
    labels: [report]
    close-older-issues: true
---

# Daily Repository Status

Analyze the repository and create a concise daily status report covering:
- Open issues and their priority
- Recent PR activity
- Upcoming work items
```

## Capabilities and limitations

Copilot supports the broadest set of `gh-aw` engine-specific features: native custom-agent selection with `engine.agent`, custom harnesses, `max-continuations`, bare mode, and per-command bash allowlisting. Copilot CLI does not provide native `tools.web-search`; configure a supported MCP search integration when the workflow requires web search. See the [AI engine feature comparison](/gh-aw/reference/engines/#engine-feature-comparison).

## GitHub Agentic Workflows vs. Copilot CLI in GitHub Actions

Running coding agent CLIs such as `copilot` directly in GitHub Actions without an adequate security architecture is not recommended. GitHub Agentic Workflows gives an appropriate security architecture and workflow portability across AI engines.
