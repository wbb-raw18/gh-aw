Staged mode lets you run a workflow and preview the [safe outputs](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/) it would create — issues, comments, pull requests, and more — without making any changes. Every write operation is skipped and replaced with a detailed 🎭 preview in the GitHub Actions step summary.

Use it to validate a new workflow before it has any real effect, or to share what a workflow *would* do before enabling it in production.

## Enabling Staged Mode

Add `staged: true` to the `safe-outputs:` block in your workflow frontmatter:

```aw wrap
---
on: issues

safe-outputs:
  staged: true
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[ai] "
    labels: [automation]
---

# Issue Analyzer

Analyze the issue and suggest follow-up tasks.
```

With this configuration the workflow runs fully — the AI completes its analysis — but no issues are created. Instead, the Actions run summary shows a preview of what would have been created.

## Scoping Staged Mode per Output Type

Use `staged: true` on a specific type to preview only that output type while letting others execute normally:

```aw wrap
---
safe-outputs:
  staged: false         # default: execute normally
  create-pull-request:
    staged: true        # PRs: preview only
  add-comment:          # comments: execute normally
---
```

A type-level `staged` setting overrides the global one, so you can pilot one risky output type while keeping other outputs fully active.

## What the Preview Looks Like

When staged mode is active, the step summary contains a structured preview for each output type. The 🎭 emoji marks every heading so previews are easy to spot:

```markdown
## 🎭 Staged Mode: Issue Creation Preview

The following 2 issue(s) would be performed if staged mode was disabled:

### Operation 1: Add caching layer to database queries

**Type**: create-issue
**Title**: Add caching layer to database queries
**Body**:
Performance profiling shows repeated queries to the users table …

**Additional Fields**:
- Labels: performance, database
- Assignees: octocat

### Operation 2: Update connection pool settings

…

---
**Preview Summary**: 2 operations previewed. No GitHub resources were created.
```

The preview includes every populated field — title, body, labels, assignees, and similar metadata — so you can review the full output before enabling it.

## Supported Output Types

Staged mode is supported by all built-in safe output types:

| Output type | What the preview shows |

[Custom safe output jobs](/gh-aw/reference/custom-safe-outputs/) receive the `GH_AW_SAFE_OUTPUTS_STAGED` environment variable set to `"true"` when staged mode is active, allowing you to implement your own preview behavior.

## Staged Mode for Custom Safe Output Jobs

Custom jobs check `GH_AW_SAFE_OUTPUTS_STAGED` to skip the real operation and display a preview instead:

```javascript
if (process.env.GH_AW_SAFE_OUTPUTS_STAGED === 'true') {
  core.info('🎭 Staged mode: would send Slack notification');
  await core.summary
    .addHeading('🎭 Staged Mode: Slack Notification Preview', 2)
    .addRaw(`**Would send**: ${process.env.MESSAGE}`)
    .write();
  return;
}

// Production path — actually send the notification
await sendSlackMessage(process.env.MESSAGE);
```

See [Custom Safe Outputs — Staged Mode Support](/gh-aw/reference/custom-safe-outputs/#staged-mode-support) for a complete example.

## Customizing Preview Messages

Override the default preview heading and description using the `messages:` block:

```aw wrap
---
safe-outputs:
  staged: true
  messages:
    staged-title: "🎭 Preview: {operation}"
    staged-description: "The following {operation} would occur if staged mode was disabled:"
  create-issue:
---
```

The `{operation}` placeholder is replaced with the safe output operation name (for example, `issue creation`).

## Recommended Workflow

A common adoption pattern is:

1. Enable `staged: true` and trigger the workflow on a real event.
2. Review the 🎭 preview in the Actions run summary.
3. Adjust the prompt or configuration.
4. Repeat until the output looks correct.
5. Disable staged mode to start creating real GitHub resources.

> [!TIP]
> Keep staged mode enabled while iterating on prompt changes, and re-enable it for a single output type when introducing a new safe output.
