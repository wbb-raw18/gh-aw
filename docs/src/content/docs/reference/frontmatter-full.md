## Schema Description

JSON Schema for validating agentic workflow frontmatter configuration

## Complete Frontmatter Reference

```yaml wrap
---
# Workflow name that appears in the GitHub Actions interface. If not specified,
# defaults to the filename without extension.
# (optional)
name: "My Workflow"

# Optional workflow description that is rendered as a comment in the generated
# GitHub Actions YAML file (.lock.yml)
# (optional)
description: "Description of the workflow"

# Optional statement of the durable outcome the workflow exists to achieve. Unlike
# 'description', which explains what the workflow does, 'intent' explains why the
# workflow exists and should stay implementation-independent. Rendered as a
# comment in the generated GitHub Actions YAML file (.lock.yml).
# (optional)
intent: "example-value"

# Optional emoji to represent the workflow visually in listings and UI surfaces.
# (optional)
emoji: "example-value"

# Optional source reference indicating where this workflow was added from. Format:
# owner/repo/path@ref (e.g., githubnext/agentics/workflows/ci-doctor.md@v1.0.0).
# Rendered as a comment in the generated lock file.
# (optional)
source: "example-value"

# Optional workflow location redirect for updates. Format: workflow spec or GitHub
# URL (e.g., owner/repo/path@ref or
# https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/path.md). When present, update follows
# this location and rewrites source.
# (optional)
redirect: "example-value"

# Optional tracker identifier to tag all created assets (issues, discussions,
# comments, pull requests). Must be at least 8 characters and contain only
# alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. This identifier will be
# inserted in the body/description of all created assets to enable searching and
# retrieving assets associated with this workflow.
# (optional)
tracker-id: "example-value"

# Auditable false-positive suppression annotations for compiler threat-detection
# rules.
# (optional)
threat-detection-suppress: []
  # Array items:
    rule: "example-value"

    reason: "example-value"

    # (optional)
    expires: "example-value"

# Optional array of labels to categorize and organize workflows. Labels can be
# used to filter workflows in status/list commands.
# (optional)
labels: []
  # Array of strings

# Optional list of skill references to install during activation. Supports remote
# repository-wide installs (`owner/repo@<sha>`), remote path-scoped installs
# (`owner/repo/skill/path@<sha>`), and local path references (e.g. `skills/rig` or
# `.github/skills/my-skill`). Remote static references may use a full 40-character
# lowercase commit SHA, or a branch/tag name (resolved to a SHA at compile time).
# Omitting the ref (`owner/repo@`) opts out of pinning and triggers a compile-time
# warning. Local paths are installed with --from-local at runtime and are
# rewritten to a remote repospec by `gh aw add`. GitHub Actions expressions (`${{
# ... }}`) are also accepted and are evaluated at runtime. Entries may also be
# objects to configure per-skill authentication via github-token or github-app.
# (optional)
skills: []

# Optional metadata field for storing custom key-value pairs compatible with the
# custom agent spec. Key names are limited to 64 characters, and values are
# limited to 1024 characters.
# (optional)
metadata:
  # Optional absolute HTTPS URL for human-facing workflow documentation. Preserved
  # in generated lock-file metadata without being fetched during compilation.
  # (optional)
  docs: "https://docs.example.com/automation/repository-health"

# Workflow specifications to import. Supports array form (list of paths) or object
# form with 'aw' (agentic workflow paths) subfield. Path resolution: (1) relative
# paths (e.g., 'shared/file.md') are resolved relative to the workflow's
# directory; (2) paths starting with '.github/' or '/' are resolved from the
# repository root (repo-root-relative); (3) paths matching 'owner/repo/path@ref'
# are fetched from GitHub at compile time (cross-repo).
# (optional)
# Accepted formats:

# Format 1: Array of workflow specifications to import. Three path formats are
# supported: relative paths ('shared/file.md'), repo-root-relative paths
# ('.github/agents/my-agent.md'), and cross-repo paths ('owner/repo/path@ref').
# Any markdown files under .github/agents directory are treated as custom agent
# files and only one agent file is allowed per workflow.
imports: []
  # Array items: undefined

# Format 2: Object form of imports with 'aw' subfield for shared agentic workflow
# paths.
imports:
  # Array of shared agentic workflow specifications to import. Format:

  aw: []

# Optional list of additional workflow or action files that should be fetched
# alongside this workflow when running 'gh aw add'. Entries are relative paths
# (from the same directory as this workflow in the source repository) to agentic
# workflow .md files or GitHub Actions .yml/.yaml files. GitHub Actions expression
# syntax (${{) is not allowed in resource paths.
# (optional)
resources: []
  # Array of Relative path to a workflow .md file or action .yml/.yaml file. Must be
  # a static path; GitHub Actions expression syntax (${{) is not allowed.

# If true, inline all imports (including those without inputs) at compilation time
# in the generated lock.yml instead of using runtime-import macros. When enabled,
# the frontmatter hash covers the entire markdown body so any change to the
# content will invalidate the hash.
# (optional)

# before the agent runs. Useful for activation steps that generate reusable
# prompt, skill, or agent context.

# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job
# (optional)
# Accepted formats:

# Runner topology configuration. Tells gh-aw and AWF what kind of runner

# contract between gh-aw and AWF for runner environment detection.
# (optional)
runner:
  # Runner execution topology. When set to 'arc-dind', gh-aw emits the topology in

# Concurrency control to limit concurrent workflow runs (GitHub Actions standard
# field). Supports two forms: simple string for basic group isolation, or object

# this with automatic per-engine concurrency policies (defaults to single job per
# engine across all workflows) and token-based rate limiting. Default behavior:
# workflows in the same group queue sequentially unless cancel-in-progress is
# true. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency
# (optional)
# Accepted formats:

# Format 1: Simple concurrency group name to prevent multiple runs in the same
# group. Use expressions like '${{ github.workflow }}' for per-workflow isolation
# or '${{ github.ref }}' for per-branch isolation. Agentic workflows automatically
# generate enhanced concurrency policies using 'gh-aw-{engine-id}' as the default
# group to limit concurrent AI workloads across all workflows using the same
# engine.
concurrency: "example-value"

# Format 2: Concurrency configuration object with group isolation and cancellation
# control. Use object form when you need fine-grained control over whether to
# cancel in-progress runs. For agentic workflows, this is useful to prevent
# multiple AI agents from running simultaneously and consuming excessive resources
# or API quotas.
concurrency:
  # Concurrency group name. Workflows in the same group cannot run simultaneously.
  # Supports GitHub Actions expressions for dynamic group names based on branch,
  # workflow, or other context.
  # (optional)
  group: "example-value"

  # Whether to cancel in-progress workflows in the same concurrency group when a new
  # one starts. Default: false (queue new runs). Set to true for agentic workflows
  # where only the latest run matters (e.g., PR analysis that becomes stale when new
  # commits are pushed).
  # (optional)
  cancel-in-progress: true

  # Pending run queue behavior for this concurrency group. 'single' (default) allows

  # (optional)
  queue: "single"

  # Additional discriminator expression appended to compiler-generated job-level
  # concurrency groups (agent, output jobs). Use this when multiple workflow
  # instances are dispatched concurrently with different inputs (fan-out pattern) to
  # prevent job-level concurrency groups from colliding. For example, '${{
  # inputs.finding_id }}' ensures each dispatched run gets a unique job-level group.

    # Accepted formats:

    # Format 1: Controls protected-file protection. request-review (default): create

    # (e.g. package.json, go.mod), engine instruction files (e.g. AGENTS.md,

        # Array of strings

    # Exclusive allowlist of glob patterns. When set, every file in the patch must

    preserve-branch-name: true

    # When true (and preserve-branch-name is true), allows the handler to force-delete

    # List of glob patterns for files to exclude from the patch. Each pattern is

# Schema for validating 'with' input values when this workflow is imported by
# another workflow using the 'uses'/'with' syntax. Defines the expected
# parameters, their types, and whether they are required. Scalar inputs are
# accessible via '${{ github.aw.import-inputs.<name> }}' expressions. Object
# inputs (type: object) allow one-level deep sub-fields accessible via '${{
# github.aw.import-inputs.<name>.<subkey> }}' expressions.
# (optional)

# Default LLM model, overridden by nested engine.model. Sets the default model
# used by the agentic engine for this workflow. Acts as a fallback when an engine
# instance does not specify its own 'model'; a nested 'engine.model' (e.g.
# safe-outputs.threat-detection.engine.model) takes precedence over this field for
# that engine instance. Supports full model IDs (e.g.
# 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'gpt-5.4') and model aliases (e.g. 'small',
# 'large').
# (optional)
model: "example-value"

# ⚠️ Experimental. Deterministic graders for workflow-run observations. Built-in
# graders use execution artifacts, custom graders use inline scripts, and the
# operational-value grader uses a repository evaluator.
# (optional)
graders:
  {}

# ⚠️ Experimental. BinEval binary evaluation questions to run after safe-outputs
# and before the conclusion job. Can be a plain list of questions (shorthand) or
# an object with questions, model, and runs-on fields.
# (optional)
# Accepted formats:

# Format 1: Shorthand form: plain list of evaluation question objects.
evals: []
  # Array items: object

# Format 2: Extended form: object with questions list and optional configuration.
evals:
  # List of binary evaluation question objects.
  # (optional)
  questions: []
    # Array items:
      # Unique identifier for the evaluation question.
      id: "example-value"

      # The binary (YES/NO) question to evaluate.
      question: "example-value"

      # Optional model override for this specific question. Overrides the top-level
      # model setting. Use a model alias such as "small" or a full model ID.
      # (optional)
      model: "example-value"

  # Default model to use for all evaluation questions. Use a model alias such as
  # "small" or a full model ID. Per-question model fields override this setting.
  # (optional)
  model: "example-value"

  # Runner type for workflow execution (GitHub Actions standard field). Supports
  # multiple forms: simple string for single runner label (e.g., 'ubuntu-latest'),
  # array for runner selection with fallbacks, or object for GitHub-hosted runner
  # groups with specific labels. For agentic workflows, runner selection matters
  # when AI workloads require specific compute resources or when using self-hosted
  # runners with specialized capabilities. Typically configured at the job level
  # instead. See
  # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job
  # (optional)
  # Accepted formats:

  # Format 1: Simple runner label string. Use for standard GitHub-hosted runners
  # (e.g., 'ubuntu-latest', 'windows-latest', 'macos-latest') or self-hosted runner
  # labels. Most common form for agentic workflows.
  runs-on: "example-value"

  # Format 2: Array of runner labels for selection with fallbacks. GitHub Actions
  # will use the first available runner that matches any label in the array. Useful
  # for high-availability setups or when multiple runner types are acceptable.
  runs-on: []
    # Array items: string

  # Format 3: Runner group configuration for GitHub-hosted runners. Use this form to
  # target specific runner groups (e.g., larger runners with more CPU/memory) or
  # self-hosted runner pools with specific label requirements. Agentic workflows may
  # benefit from larger runners for complex AI processing tasks.
  runs-on:
    # Runner group name for self-hosted runners or GitHub-hosted runner groups
    # (optional)
    group: "example-value"

    # List of runner labels for self-hosted runners or GitHub-hosted runner selection
    # (optional)
    labels: []
      # Array of strings
