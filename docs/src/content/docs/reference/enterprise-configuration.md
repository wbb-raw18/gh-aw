# Enterprise Configuration

This page covers configuration options specific to GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) and GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) deployments.

## GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) Compatibility

### GHES Compatibility Mode

GHES instances running versions that predate `@actions/artifact` v2.0.0 support cannot use `actions/upload-artifact@v4+` or `actions/download-artifact@v4+`. Attempting to run compiled workflows on these instances produces a `GHESNotSupportedError`.

gh-aw includes a GHES compatibility mode toggle (`aw.json` `ghes` or `gh aw compile --ghes`) for GHES releases that require the v3 artifact backend. Compatibility mode emits `upload-artifact@v3.2.2` and `download-artifact@v3.1.0`; default GitHub.com compilation continues to use the latest artifact actions.

This compatibility path supports GHES 3.21.x and earlier when the workflow runs on Actions Runner 2.327.1 or later, which is required by the Node.js 24 runtime used by these pinned artifact actions. For later GHES releases, keep compatibility mode enabled until your instance supports the v4 artifact backend.

#### Enable via `aw.json` (recommended)

Set `ghes: true` in `.github/workflows/aw.json` to apply GHES compatibility to every workflow compiled in the repository:

```json
{
  "ghes": true
}
```

#### Auto-detection with `gh aw init`

Running `gh aw init` inside a GHES repository automatically detects the deployment and writes `ghes: true` to `.github/workflows/aw.json`. No manual configuration is required.

#### Enable via CLI flag

Pass `--ghes` to `gh aw compile` for a one-off compilation without modifying `aw.json`:

```bash
gh aw compile --ghes my-workflow.md
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `--ghes` flag only affects the current compilation. Use `aw.json` to apply GHES compatibility permanently across all workflows in the repository.

## GitHub Enterprise Server CLI Setup

For `gh` CLI configuration, host authentication, and `GH_HOST` setup on GHES, see [GitHub Enterprise Server Support](/gh-aw/setup/cli/#github-enterprise-server-support) in the CLI reference.

## Copilot Engine on GHES

For Copilot-specific prerequisites, licensing requirements, and firewall configuration on GHES, see [Copilot Engine Prerequisites on GHES](/gh-aw/troubleshooting/common-issues/#copilot-engine-prerequisites-on-ghes).
