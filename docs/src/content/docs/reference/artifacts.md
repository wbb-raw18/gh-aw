GitHub Agentic Workflows upload several artifacts during workflow execution. This reference documents every artifact name, its contents, and how to access the data — especially for downstream workflows that use `gh run download` directly instead of `gh aw logs`.

## Quick Reference

| Artifact Name | Constant | Type | Description |
|---------------|----------|------|-------------|
| `agent` | `constants.AgentArtifactName`<br/>Source: `pkg/constants/job_constants.go` | Multi-file | Unified agent job outputs (logs, safe outputs, token usage summary) |
| `agent-output-fallback` | `constants.AgentOutputFallbackArtifactName` | Multi-file | Small dedicated copy of the processed agent output (`agent_output.json`) and raw safe-output NDJSON (`safeoutputs.jsonl`), used when the larger `agent` upload fails or times out |
| `activation` | `constants.ActivationArtifactName` | Multi-file | Activation job output (`aw_info.json`, `prompt.txt`, rate limits) |
| `firewall-audit-logs` | `constants.FirewallAuditArtifactName`<br/>Source: `pkg/constants/constants.go` | Multi-file | AWF firewall audit/observability logs (token usage, network policy, audit trail) |
| `detection` | `constants.DetectionArtifactName` | Conditional | Legacy inline engine (`features.gh-aw-detection: false`): single-file `detection.log`. The default external `gh-aw-detection` engine: multi-file `detection_result.json` + `step-summary.md`; `detection.log` is intentionally **not** uploaded (see below) |
| `safe-output` | `constants.SafeOutputArtifactName` | Legacy/back-compat | Historical standalone safe output artifact (`safe_output.jsonl`); in current compiled workflows this content is included in the unified `agent` artifact instead |
| `agent-output` | `constants.AgentOutputArtifactName` | Legacy/back-compat | Historical standalone agent output artifact (`agent_output.json`); in current compiled workflows this content is included in the unified `agent` artifact instead |
| `info` | `constants.InfoArtifactName` | Single-file | Standalone copy of the workflow run information (`aw_info.json`), uploaded by the activation job in addition to the copy bundled in the `activation` artifact |
| `aw-info` | — | Legacy/back-compat | Historical standalone engine-configuration artifact (`aw_info.json`); current compiled workflows upload this as `info` instead |
| `prompt` | — | Legacy/back-compat | Historical standalone prompt artifact (`prompt.txt`); in current compiled workflows `prompt.txt` is included in the `activation` artifact instead |
| `experiment` | `constants.ExperimentArtifactName` | Multi-file | A/B experiment state (`state.json`) uploaded by the activation job when experiments are declared in the frontmatter |
| `usage` | `constants.UsageArtifactName` | Multi-file | Compact conclusion-job artifact with workflow-run metadata and token-usage files used by lightweight reporting and forecasting paths |
| `evals` | `constants.EvalsArtifactName` | Single-file | BinEval evaluation results (`evals.jsonl`) uploaded by the evals job when `evals` are declared in the workflow frontmatter |
| `safe-outputs-items` | `constants.SafeOutputItemsArtifactName` | Multi-file | Safe output items manifest (`safe-output-items.jsonl`), temporary ID map (`temporary-id-map.json`), and failure diagnostics (`safe-output-errors.json`, written only when the `Process Safe Outputs` step fails) |
| `code-scanning-sarif` | `constants.SarifArtifactName` | Single-file | SARIF file for code scanning results |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sync note: This table mirrors artifact-name constants in `pkg/constants/job_constants.go` and `pkg/constants/constants.go`. When those constant values change, update this page and the downstream artifact references in `docs/src/content/docs/reference/audit.md` and `docs/src/content/docs/reference/cost-management.md`.

## Legacy artifact names

:::caution[Deprecated]
`safe-output` and `agent-output` became legacy in the gh-aw `v0.34.x` unified-agent-artifact rollout. New downstream consumers should migrate to the unified `agent` artifact now; `gh aw logs` and `gh aw audit` keep reading the legacy names only for back-compat with older runs. Removal is planned no earlier than gh-aw `v1.0`.

## Artifact Sets

The `gh aw logs` and `gh aw audit` commands support `--artifacts` to download only specific artifact groups:

| Set Name | Artifacts Downloaded | Use Case |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| `all` | Everything | Full analysis (default) |
| `agent` | `agent` | Agent logs and outputs |
| `activation` | `activation` | Activation data (`aw_info.json`, `prompt.txt`) |
| `firewall` | `firewall-audit-logs` | Network policy and firewall audit data |
| `mcp` | `firewall-audit-logs` | MCP gateway traffic logs |
| `detection` | `detection` | Threat detection output |
| `experiment` | `experiment` | A/B experiment state (only present when experiments are declared) |
| `usage` | `usage` | Compact conclusion-job artifact for lightweight reporting and forecasting |
| `evals` | `evals` | BinEval evaluation results (only present when `evals` are declared) |
| `graders` | `usage`, `agent`, `agent-output-fallback` | Deterministic grader results (only present when `graders` are declared) |
| `github-api` | `activation`, `agent` | GitHub API rate limit logs |

```bash
# Download only firewall artifacts
gh aw logs <run-id> --artifacts firewall

# Download agent and firewall artifacts
gh aw logs <run-id> --artifacts agent --artifacts firewall

# Download everything (default)
gh aw logs <run-id>
```

## `firewall-audit-logs`

The `firewall-audit-logs` artifact is uploaded by **all firewall-enabled workflows**. It contains AWF (Agent Workflow Firewall) structured audit and observability logs.

> **⚠️ Important:** This artifact is **separate** from the `agent` artifact. Token usage data (`token-usage.jsonl`) lives here, not in the `agent` artifact.

### Directory Structure

```
firewall-audit-logs/
├── api-proxy-logs/
│   ├── token-usage.jsonl        ← Token usage data (input/output/cache tokens per API request)
│   └── token-diag.log           ← Token diagnostics JSONL (only when AWF_DEBUG_TOKENS=1)
├── squid-logs/
│   └── access.log               ← Network policy log (domain allow/deny decisions)
├── audit.jsonl                  ← Firewall audit trail (policy matches, rule evaluations)
└── policy-manifest.json         ← Policy configuration snapshot
```

`token-diag.log` is written by the AWF api-proxy `diag()` path (`containers/api-proxy/token-persistence.js`) to `$AWF_TOKEN_LOG_DIR/token-diag.log` (default `/var/log/api-proxy/token-diag.log`). It is only emitted when `AWF_DEBUG_TOKENS=1`, so set that environment variable on the workflow step that runs with AWF enabled when you need token diagnostics.

### Accessing Token Usage Data

**Recommended: Use `gh aw logs`**

```bash
# Download and analyze firewall data
gh aw logs <run-id> --artifacts firewall

# Output as JSON for scripting
gh aw logs <run-id> --artifacts firewall --json
```

**Direct download with `gh run download`:**

```bash
# Download the firewall-audit-logs artifact
gh run download <run-id> -n firewall-audit-logs

# Token usage data is at:
cat firewall-audit-logs/api-proxy-logs/token-usage.jsonl

# Network access log is at:
cat firewall-audit-logs/squid-logs/access.log

# Audit trail is at:
cat firewall-audit-logs/audit.jsonl

# Policy manifest is at:
cat firewall-audit-logs/policy-manifest.json
```

### Common Mistake

Downstream workflows sometimes download `agent-artifacts` or `agent` expecting to find `token-usage.jsonl`. This will silently return no data — the token usage file is only in the `firewall-audit-logs` artifact.

```bash
# ❌ WRONG — token-usage.jsonl is NOT in the agent artifact
gh run download <run-id> -n agent
cat agent/token-usage.jsonl  # File not found!

# ✅ CORRECT — download from firewall-audit-logs
gh run download <run-id> -n firewall-audit-logs
cat firewall-audit-logs/api-proxy-logs/token-usage.jsonl
```

### JSON Schemas

The JSONL files in this artifact are described by versioned JSON Schemas published by [github/gh-aw-firewall](https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall). Each record includes a `_schema` field (for example `"audit/v0.26.0"`) so consumers can identify the record type and AWF version.

| File | Schema asset | Pinned URL |
|------|--------------|------------|
| `audit.jsonl` | `audit.schema.json` | `https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall/releases/download/<tag>/audit.schema.json` |
| `api-proxy-logs/token-usage.jsonl` | `token-usage.schema.json` | `https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall/releases/download/<tag>/token-usage.schema.json` |

Use `releases/latest/download/` in place of a specific tag to track the most recent published release. Schemas are versioned by AWF release tag; consumers should match `_schema` by prefix (for example `_schema.startsWith("audit/")`) so additive changes remain non-breaking.

## `agent`

The unified `agent` artifact contains agent job outputs:

- Agent execution logs
- Safe output data (`agent_output.json`)
- GitHub API rate limit logs (`github_rate_limits.jsonl`)
- Token usage summary (`agent_usage.json`) — aggregated totals only; per-request data is in `firewall-audit-logs`. When AWF records include valid `ai_credits_this_response` and `ai_credits_total` values, the summary preserves those reported values instead of repricing the tokens.
- `otel.jsonl` — OTLP span mirror written by gh-aw's JavaScript span exporters when `observability.otlp` is configured

For OTLP configuration, runtime environment variables, and span semantics, see the [OpenTelemetry guide](/gh-aw/reference/open-telemetry/).

## `activation`

The `activation` artifact contains activation job outputs:

- `aw_info.json` — Engine configuration and workflow metadata
- `prompt.txt` — The generated prompt sent to the AI agent
- `github_rate_limits.jsonl` — Rate limit data from the activation job

## `detection`

The `detection` artifact is conditional:

- Inline engine (default): `detection.log`, the threat-detection analysis output. Legacy name: `threat-detection.log`.
- External `gh-aw-detection` engine (the default, or `features.gh-aw-detection: true`): `detection_result.json` and `step-summary.md`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When the external `gh-aw-detection` engine is used (the default, or `features.gh-aw-detection: true`), `detection.log` is not uploaded: it can contain content derived from the untrusted agent transcript that was passed to the detection engine (including secrets the agent may have echoed), so uploading it as a downloadable artifact would be a secret-exfiltration path. On that path the `detection` artifact contains `detection_result.json` (the structured verdict) and `step-summary.md`.

## `experiment`

The `experiment` artifact is uploaded by the activation job only when the workflow frontmatter declares one or more `experiments` entries. It contains:

- `state.json` — Cumulative per-variant invocation counters used to balance A/B assignments across runs

### Accessing experiment data

```bash
# Download the experiment artifact for a specific run
gh aw audit <run-id> --artifacts experiment

# Display the A/B experiment section in the audit report
gh aw audit <run-id>
```

The `🧪 A/B Experiments` section of the audit report shows the variant chosen for the run and the cumulative counts:

```
🧪 A/B Experiments
  • style = concise (cumulative: concise:5, detailed:4)
```

See [A/B Experiments](/gh-aw/experimental/experiments/) for how to declare experiments in workflow frontmatter.

## `usage`

The `usage` artifact is a compact conclusion-job artifact with workflow-run metadata and token-usage files for lightweight reporting and forecasting, so downstream tools can read aggregated usage data without downloading the full `agent` artifact.

Its `activity/summary.json` file uses the `usage-activity-summary/v1` schema. The optional activity sections are additive; the `working_set` section is always written when the calculation step executes:

```json

}
```

MCP `tool_calls` contain quantitative metadata only. Tool-call IDs are replaced with
run-local opaque identifiers, and request and response content is never copied into
the usage artifact. `outcome` is `success`, `failure`, or `incomplete`.

`safe_outputs.items` contains the provider-neutral records from the safe-output manifest.
Each record identifies the provider and operation and includes the available URL, repository,
number, provider ID, human-readable identifier, target, and label details. This lets consumers
reconstruct created GitHub, Jira, Linear, and other provider entities from the usage artifact
without querying those services. Label records include the associated issue or pull request,
label name, and GitHub database or node ID when returned by the API.

The conclusion job derives `gateway` and `integrity` from MCP gateway logs, falling back to `rpc-messages.jsonl` when `gateway.jsonl` is unavailable. These compact aggregates let `gh aw logs --artifacts usage` report MCP call, payload-size, duration, failure, and integrity-filter metrics without downloading raw logs. Cross-run reports include `runs_with_filtered_events`; the existing logs report summary remains the source for the total number of runs.

`rebuild_factor` is `cumulative_input_tokens / peak_input_tokens`, where each invocation contributes the canonical `input_tokens` value from the agent `token_usage.jsonl` record. Cache-read and cache-write fields are not added because provider normalization has already produced that logical input count. The factor is omitted when `measurement_state` is `unavailable`; `partial` means usable records were measured but malformed or unsupported records were ignored.

Working-Set Rebuild Factor measures cumulative context reconstruction relative to peak invocation context. It is an efficiency/trajectory metric, not a measurement of semantic coherence debt and not a predictor of task success. It cannot identify missing task facts or classify outcome quality. The metric is conceptually inspired by [“The Working Set of a Coding Agent: Coherence Debt in Repository-Scale Tasks”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.16630), while deliberately limiting the implementation to observable token traffic.

### Accessing usage data

Token-usage files are diagnostic data produced in the agent runtime. Their mirrored AIC fields support usage reporting and analysis, but are not sufficient evidence to classify a provider failure as a trusted budget-enforcement event.

```bash
# Download only the usage artifact
gh aw logs <run-id> --artifacts usage

# Or with gh run download
gh run download <run-id> -n usage
```

## `evals`

The `evals` artifact is uploaded by the evals job only when the workflow frontmatter declares one or more `evals` entries. It is not present on runs without evals and contains:

- `evals.jsonl` — Per-question BinEval evaluation results (YES/NO records) produced by running the declared evaluation questions against the agent output

### Accessing evals data

```bash
# Download only the evals artifact
gh aw logs <run-id> --artifacts evals

# Or with gh run download
gh run download <run-id> -n evals
```

The `gh aw audit` command exposes an `--evals` flag that skips runs without evals results and automatically downloads the evals artifact when `--artifacts` is narrowed:

```bash
# Audit only runs that contain evals results
gh aw audit <run-id> --evals
```

## Grader files

When the workflow frontmatter declares one or more `graders`, the grader files are stored inside existing artifacts rather than uploaded as a standalone `graders` artifact. They live under `agent/graders/` in the unified `agent` artifact, under `graders/` in the `agent-output-fallback` artifact when the fallback transport is used, and under `usage/graders/` after the conclusion job mirrors them for lightweight downloads. The files are:

- `grader_manifest.json` — The configured graders with their unit, direction, and threshold
- `grader_results.json` — The validated grader results (status, raw value, pass/fail) computed from the run trace

### Accessing graders data

```bash
# Download the artifacts that carry grader results
gh aw logs <run-id> --artifacts graders

# Or with gh run download against the actual artifacts
gh run download <run-id> -n usage
gh run download <run-id> -n agent
gh run download <run-id> -n agent-output-fallback
```

`gh aw audit` reports grader outcomes in its console output and includes them in the JSON report under the `graders` key (results, plus `total`, `passed`, `failed`, `error_count`, and `unavailable_count`). The artifact also retains the exact operational-value evaluator bytes used for that run.

## Naming Compatibility

Artifact names changed between upload-artifact v4 and v5. The `gh aw logs` and `gh aw audit` commands handle both naming schemes transparently:

| Old Name (pre-v5) | New Name (v5+) | File Inside |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `aw_info.json` | `aw-info` | `aw_info.json` |
| `safe_output.jsonl` | `safe-output` | `safe_output.jsonl` |
| `agent_output.json` | `agent-output` | `agent_output.json` |
| `prompt.txt` | `prompt` | `prompt.txt` |
| `threat-detection.log` | `detection` | `detection.log` (inline engine only) |

Single-file artifacts are automatically flattened to root level regardless of their artifact directory name. Multi-file artifacts (`firewall-audit-logs`, `agent`, `activation`, `experiment`, and `detection` when the external `gh-aw-detection` engine is enabled) retain their directory structure.

## Workflow Call Prefixes

When workflows are invoked via `workflow_call`, GitHub Actions prepends a short hash to artifact names (e.g., `abc123-firewall-audit-logs`). The CLI handles this automatically by matching artifact names that end with `-{base-name}`.

```bash
# Both of these are recognized as the firewall artifact:
# - firewall-audit-logs           (direct invocation)
# - abc123-firewall-audit-logs    (workflow_call invocation)
```
