GitHub Agentic Workflows add the convenience `slash_command:` trigger to create workflows that respond to `/my-bots` in issues and comments.

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot  # Optional: defaults to filename without .md extension
```

You can also use shorthand formats:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command: "my-bot"  # Shorthand: string directly specifies command name
```

```yaml wrap
on: /my-bot  # Ultra-short: slash prefix automatically expands to slash_command + workflow_dispatch
```

## Multiple Command Identifiers

A single workflow can respond to multiple slash command names by providing an array:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: ["cmd.add", "cmd.remove", "cmd.list"]
```

When triggered, the matched command is available as `needs.activation.outputs.slash_command`, allowing your workflow to determine which command was used:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  slash_command:
    name: ["summarize", "summary", "tldr"]
---

# Multi-Command Handler

You invoked the workflow using: `/${{ needs.activation.outputs.slash_command }}`

Now analyzing the content...
```

This enables aliases and grouped handlers without duplicating workflows.

The compiler automatically creates issue/PR triggers (`opened`, `edited`, `reopened`), comment triggers (`created`, `edited`), and conditional execution for `/command-name` mentions. The command must be the **first word** of the comment or body text to avoid accidental triggers.

**Code availability:** When a command is triggered from a pull request body, PR comment, or PR review comment, the coding agent has access to both the PR branch and the default branch.

You can combine `slash_command:` with other events like `workflow_dispatch` or `schedule`:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule: weekly on monday
```

### Centralized trigger strategy

Set `on.slash_command.strategy: centralized` to route slash commands through a shared dispatcher. The workflow compiles as `workflow_dispatch`-centric, and the compiler generates one `agentic_commands.yml` workflow that listens to merged slash-command events and dispatches matching target workflows with `aw_context`.

Centralized routing also enables a builtin `/help` command that comments on the current issue, pull request, or discussion with the supported slash commands, their descriptions, and a link to this documentation.

To disable the builtin handler, set the top-level `help_command` field in `.github/workflows/aw.json`:

```json
{
  "help_command": false
}
```

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot
    strategy: centralized
```

With the default inline strategy, you cannot combine `slash_command` with `issues`, `issue_comment`, or `pull_request` because those triggers conflict. With `strategy: centralized`, non-slash events are preserved because slash matching moves to the generated central trigger workflow.

You can still combine `slash_command` with `issues` or `pull_request` when those events are label-only (`labeled` or `unlabeled`).

### Combining `slash_command` with `bots:`

:::caution[Concurrency clash]
Combining `slash_command` with `on.bots:` produces a compile-time warning. When a bot listed in `bots:` posts a comment that begins with the slash command text (e.g., `/command-name`), the command check passes and the bot triggers the workflow — occupying the concurrency slot and potentially blocking a simultaneous manual invocation, since `cancel-in-progress` is disabled for command-trigger workflows.

To ensure the workflow only runs on explicit user commands, remove the `bots:` field.
:::

```yaml wrap
# This configuration produces a compile-time warning:
on:
  slash_command:
    name: rust-review
    events: [pull_request, pull_request_comment]
  bots:
    - "copilot[bot]"
```

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command: deploy
  issues:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled]  # Valid: label-only triggers don't conflict
```

This pattern is useful when you want a workflow that can be triggered both manually via commands and automatically when labels change.

## Filtering Command Events

By default, command triggers listen to all comment-related events, which can create skipped runs in the Actions UI. Use `events:` to restrict where commands are active:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot
    events: [issues, issue_comment]  # Only in issue bodies and issue comments
```

**Supported events:** `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request`, `pull_request_comment`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `discussion`, `discussion_comment`, or `*` (all, default).

:::note
Both `issue_comment` and `pull_request_comment` map to GitHub Actions' `issue_comment` event with automatic filtering to distinguish between issue and PR comments.
:::

### Example command workflows

Issue-only command (avoids skipped runs from PR events):

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: investigate
    events: [issues, issue_comment]
```

PR-only command:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: code-review
    events: [pull_request, pull_request_comment]
```

## Context Text

All workflows access `steps.sanitized.outputs.text`, which provides **sanitized** context: for issues and PRs, it's `title + "\n\n" + body`; for comments and reviews, it's the body content.

```aw wrap
# Analyze this content: "${{ steps.sanitized.outputs.text }}"
```

Use sanitized context instead of raw event fields. It neutralizes @mentions and bot triggers (such as `fixes #123`), protects against XML injection, filters URIs to trusted HTTPS domains, limits content size (0.5MB max, 65k lines), and strips ANSI escape sequences.

```aw wrap
# RECOMMENDED: Secure sanitized context
Analyze this issue: "${{ steps.sanitized.outputs.text }}"

# DISCOURAGED: Raw context values (security risks)
Title: "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
Body: "${{ github.event.issue.body }}"
```

## Reactions and Status Comments

Command workflows default to `reaction: eyes` (👀) and `status-comment: true`. The reaction marks the triggering comment, and the status comment posts started/completed updates with a workflow run link.

Customize or disable either:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot
  reaction: "rocket"       # Override default "eyes"
  status-comment: false    # Disable the status comment
```

To disable the reaction entirely, use `reaction: none`.

See [Reactions and Status Comments](/gh-aw/reference/triggers/#reactions-reaction) for all available reactions and detailed behavior.

## Customizing the Run-Again Hint (`placeholder`)

For workflows with a `slash_command:` trigger, the default footer on generated issues and pull requests includes a hint showing how to invoke the workflow again:

> <sub>Comment <em>/my-bot</em> to run again</sub>

Override the trailing `"to run again"` suffix with `placeholder:`:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: review-bot
    placeholder: to review this PR
```

The footer hint then reads:

> <sub>Comment <em>/review-bot</em> to review this PR</sub>

The hint is appended only by the default footer template. Custom footer templates are unaffected.

## Slash Commands from a Side Repository

GitHub Actions only delivers events to the repository where they occur, so events from the main repository never reach workflows hosted in a side repository. **Slash command triggers cannot be used directly in a workflow hosted in a side repository.**

Use a **bridge pattern** instead: a thin relay workflow in the main repository receives the slash command and forwards it to the side repository via `workflow_dispatch`.

See [Triage from Side Repo](/gh-aw/gallery/multi-repo/triage-from-side-repo/) for a full walkthrough with examples and trade-offs.
