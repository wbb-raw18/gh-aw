## Syntax

Use `imports:` in frontmatter or `{{#import ...}}` in markdown to share workflow components across multiple workflows.

```aw wrap
---
on: issues

engine: copilot

imports:
  - shared/common-tools.md
  - shared/mcp/tavily.md
---

# Your Workflow

Workflow instructions here...
```

### Parameterized imports (`uses`/`with`)

Shared workflows that declare an `import-schema` accept runtime parameters. Use the `uses`/`with` form to pass values:

```aw wrap
---
on: issues

engine: copilot

imports:
  - uses: shared/mcp/serena.md
    with:
      languages: ["go", "typescript"]
---
```

`uses` is an alias for `path`; `with` is an alias for `inputs`.

Conditional frontmatter imports are not supported. If an experiment should vary shared prompt content, keep imports unconditional and gate `{{#runtime-import? ...}}` (optional form) inside your `{{#if experiments.<name> ...}}` block instead. The optional form is not promoted to unconditional lock-file macros, so the content is only injected when the condition is true at runtime.

### Single-import constraint

A workflow file can appear at most once in an import graph. If the same file is imported more than once with identical `with` values it is silently deduplicated. Importing the same file with **different** `with` values is a compile-time error:

```
import conflict: 'shared/mcp/serena.md' is imported more than once with different 'with' values.
An imported workflow can only be imported once per workflow.
  Previous 'with': {"languages":["go"]}
  New 'with':      {"languages":["typescript"]}
```

In markdown, use `{{#runtime-import filepath}}` to inject the content of another file directly into the body at that position. This is useful for sharing reusable prompt snippets, tone instructions, or reference material across workflows.

Imported markdown can include safe GitHub Actions expressions such as `${{ needs.pre_activation.outputs.activated }}` or `${{ needs.build.outputs.version }}`. gh-aw validates those expressions across the full nested runtime-import tree at compile time, so shared prompt files can reuse job outputs without weakening expression-safety checks.

```aw wrap
---
on: schedule

engine: copilot
---

{{#runtime-import .github/shared/editorial.md}}

# Daily Report

Generate the daily report.
```

Use `{{#runtime-import? filepath}}` to silently skip a missing file instead of failing:

```aw wrap
{{#runtime-import .github/shared/editorial.md}}    # required — fails if missing
{{#runtime-import? .github/shared/optional.md}}    # optional — skipped if missing
```

Paths are resolved within the `.github` folder. You can specify paths with or without the `.github/` prefix — both `.github/shared/editorial.md` and `shared/editorial.md` refer to the same file. See [Runtime Imports](/gh-aw/reference/templating/#runtime-imports) for URLs, line ranges, and security details.

## Shared Workflow Components

Files without a trigger event are shared workflow components. They are validated, importable by other workflows, and not compiled into standalone GitHub Actions. Shared components may also define import-safe `on` keys (`skip-if-match`, `skip-if-no-match`, `skip-roles`, `skip-bots`, `github-token`, `github-app`) plus the top-level `ambient-folders` field.

Comment-only frontmatter still counts as present, so the file parses as a shared component and produces an empty frontmatter map instead of failing with `no frontmatter found`. Only missing or whitespace-only frontmatter is rejected.

If you often import the same pair together, bundle them into one shared file:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  schedule: daily

engine: copilot

imports:
  - shared/reporting-otlp.md
---
```

`shared/reporting-otlp.md` combines `shared/reporting.md` and `shared/otlp.md` for telemetry-enabled reporting workflows.

## Import Schema (`import-schema`)

Use `import-schema` to declare a typed parameter contract. Callers pass values via `with`; the compiler validates them and substitutes them into the shared file's frontmatter and body before processing.

```aw wrap
---
# shared/deploy.md — no 'on:' field, shared component only
import-schema:
  region:
    type: string
    required: true
  environment:
    type: choice
    options: [staging, production]
    required: true
  count:
    type: number
    default: 10
  languages:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    required: true
  config:
    type: object
    description: Configuration object
    properties:
      apiKey:
        type: string
        required: true
      timeout:
        type: number
        default: 30

mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    url: "https://example.com/mcp"
    allowed: ["*"]
---

Deploy ${{ github.aw.import-inputs.count }} items to ${{ github.aw.import-inputs.region }}.
API key: ${{ github.aw.import-inputs.config.apiKey }}.
Languages: ${{ github.aw.import-inputs.languages }}.
```

### Supported types

| Type | Description | Extra fields |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `string` | Plain text value | — |
| `number` | Numeric value | — |
| `boolean` | `true`/`false` | — |
| `choice` | One of a fixed set of strings | `options: [...]` |
| `array` | Ordered list of values | `items.type` (element type) |
| `object` | Key/value map | `properties` (one level deep) |

Each field supports `required: true` and an optional `default` value.

### Accessing inputs in shared workflows

Use `${{ github.aw.import-inputs.<key> }}` to substitute a top-level value; use dotted notation for object sub-fields (e.g. `${{ github.aw.import-inputs.config.apiKey }}`). Substitution applies to both frontmatter and body, so inputs can drive any field such as `mcp-servers` or `runtimes`.

### Calling a parameterized shared workflow

```aw wrap
---
on: issues

engine: copilot

imports:
  - uses: shared/deploy.md
    with:
      region: us-east-1
      environment: staging
      count: 5
      languages: ["go", "typescript"]
      config:
        apiKey: my-secret-key
        timeout: 60
---
```

The compiler validates `required` fields, `choice` options, array element types, and object `properties`. Unknown keys are compile-time errors.

## Path Resolution

Imports resolve by path format:

### Relative paths (default)

Paths that do not start with `.github/`, `/`, or an `owner/repo/` prefix resolve relative to the importing workflow's directory. With the default `--dir`, that directory is `.github/workflows/`.

```aw wrap
---
on: issues

engine: copilot

imports:
  - shared/common-tools.md        # → .github/workflows/shared/common-tools.md
  - ../agents/helper.md           # → .github/agents/helper.md (.. goes up from .github/workflows/)
---
```

### Repo-root-relative paths

Paths starting with `.github/` or `/` resolve from the repository root. Absolute paths (`/`) must point inside `.github/` or `.agents/`; any other prefix is rejected at compile time.

```aw wrap
---
on: pull_request

engine: copilot

imports:
  - .github/agents/code-reviewer.md   # resolved from repo root
  - .github/workflows/shared/app.md   # resolved from repo root
---
```

Use this form when workflows in different directories need the same stable import path, and for files under `.github/agents/`.

### Cross-repo imports

Paths matching `owner/repo/path@ref` are fetched from GitHub at compile time. The `@ref` suffix can be a semantic tag (`@v1.0.0`), branch (`@main`), or commit SHA. Remote imports are cached in `.github/aw/imports/` by commit SHA to support offline compilation; local imports are never cached. See [Adding Existing Workflows](/gh-aw/guides/working-with-workflows/#adding-existing-workflows) for installation flows.

```aw wrap
---
on: issues

engine: copilot

imports:
  - acme-org/shared-workflows/shared/reporting.md@v2.1.0   # pinned to a tag
  - acme-org/shared-workflows/shared/tools.md@main         # track a branch
  - acme-org/shared-workflows/shared/helpers.md@abc1234    # locked to a SHA
---
```

### Section references and optional imports

Append `#SectionName` to import one section from a markdown file:

```
imports:
  - shared/tools.md#WebSearch
```

Append `?` to make an import optional so missing files are skipped instead of failing compilation. This works in both frontmatter and body-level directives:

```yaml
# Frontmatter — optional
imports:
  - shared/optional-tools.md?
```

```aw wrap
# Body — optional content injection
{{#runtime-import? .github/shared/optional.md}}
```

## Agent Files

Agent files are markdown documents in `.github/agents/` that add specialized instructions to the AI engine. Import them as either local or remote paths — files under `.github/agents/` are automatically recognized as agent files, and only **one agent file** may be imported per workflow.

```yaml wrap
---
on: pull_request
engine: copilot
imports:
  - .github/agents/code-reviewer.md                                       # local
  - githubnext/shared-agents/.github/agents/security-reviewer.md@v1.0.0   # remote, pinned
---
```

Remote agent imports support the same `@ref` versioning and SHA-keyed caching as other remote imports.

## Frontmatter Merging

### Allowed Import Fields

Shared workflow files (without `on:` field) can define the fields below. Other fields generate warnings and are ignored. Agent files (`.github/agents/*.md`) may additionally define `name` and `description`.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `import-schema` | Parameter schema for `with` validation and input substitution |
| `tools` | Tool configurations (`bash`, `web-fetch`, `github`, `mcp-*`, etc.) |
| `mcp-servers` | Model Context Protocol server configurations |
| `mcp-scripts` | MCP Scripts configurations |
| `services` | Docker services for workflow execution |
| `safe-outputs` | Safe output handlers and configuration |
| `network` | Network permission specifications |
| `permissions` | GitHub Actions permissions (validated, not merged) |
| `runtimes` | Runtime version overrides (node, python, go, etc.) |
| `plugins` | Agent Plugin references |
| `secret-masking` | Secret masking steps |
| `env` | Workflow-level environment variables |
| `pre-agent-steps` | Steps that run after artifacts download, before engine execution |
| `post-steps` | Steps that run after engine execution |
| `github-app` | GitHub App credentials for token minting |
| `checkout` | Checkout configuration for the agent job |
| `engine.mcp` | MCP gateway settings (`tool-timeout`, `session-timeout`); engine identifier itself is always inherited from the importing workflow |

### Field-Specific Merge Semantics

Imported step fields use dependency order: a file's steps are processed after the steps from everything it imports and before the steps from anything that imports it. Ties retain declaration order, and circular imports fail at compile time. Other fields keep discovery order (direct imports first, then nested), so first-wins scalar precedence remains backward compatible.

| Field | Merge strategy |
|-------|---------------|
| `tools:` | Deep merge; `allowed` arrays concatenate and deduplicate. MCP tool conflicts fail except on `allowed` arrays. |
| `mcp-servers:` | Imported servers override same-named main servers; first-wins across imports. |
| `network:` | `allowed` domains union (deduped, sorted). Main `mode` and `firewall` take precedence. |
| `permissions:` | Validation only. Main must declare all imported permissions at sufficient levels (`write` ≥ `read` ≥ `none`). |
| `safe-outputs:` | Each type may be defined once; main overrides imports. Duplicate types across imports fail. |
| `runtimes:` | Main overrides imports; imported values fill unspecified fields. |
| `plugins:` | Union by plugin path. Identical refs are deduplicated; compatible semantic versions select the highest version. Incompatible major versions or conflicting non-semver refs fail. |
| `services:` | All services merge; duplicate names fail compilation. |
| `github-app:` | Main takes precedence; otherwise the first imported value is used. |
| `checkout:` | Imported entries are appended after the main workflow's entries. For duplicate `(repository, path)` pairs, the main entry wins: first-seen wins for `ref`, auth is mutually exclusive, and `checkout: false` in the main workflow disables all checkout, including imported entries. |
| `engine.mcp` | First-wins across imports. Shared files may define only `mcp.tool-timeout` and/or `mcp.session-timeout`; the importing workflow's engine identifier always wins. |
| `steps:` | Imported steps are prepended to main in dependency order; prerequisites precede dependents and unrelated siblings retain declaration order. |
| `pre-agent-steps:` | Imported pre-agent steps are prepended to main in dependency order; prerequisites precede dependents and unrelated siblings retain declaration order. |
| `post-steps:` | Imported post-steps are appended after main in dependency order; prerequisites precede dependents and unrelated siblings retain declaration order. |
| `jobs:` | Not merged; define only in the main workflow. Use `safe-outputs.jobs` for importable jobs. |
| `safe-outputs.jobs` | Names must be unique; duplicates fail. Order is determined by `needs:` dependencies. |
| `env:` | Main env vars take precedence. Duplicate keys across imports fail compilation; move the override to the main workflow. |

Example — `tools.bash.allowed` merging:

```aw wrap
# main.md: [write]
# import:  [read, list]
# result:  [read, list, write]
```

### Importing Steps

Share reusable pre-execution steps — such as token rotation, environment setup, or gate checks — across multiple workflows by defining them in a shared file:

```aw title="shared/rotate-token.md" wrap
---
description: Shared token rotation setup
steps:
  - name: Rotate GitHub App token
    id: get-token
    uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
    with:
      client-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
      private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
---
```

Any workflow that imports this file gets the rotation step prepended before its own steps:

```aw title="my-workflow.md" wrap
---
on: issues
engine: copilot
imports:
  - shared/rotate-token.md
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
steps:
  - name: Prepare context
    run: echo "context ready"
---

# My Workflow

Process the issue using the rotated token from the imported step.
```

Steps from imports run **before** steps defined in the main workflow. Imported prerequisites run before the files that depend on them, while unrelated sibling imports retain declaration order.

### Importing MCP Servers

Define an MCP server configuration once and import it wherever needed:

```aw title="shared/mcp/tavily.md" wrap
---
description: Tavily web search MCP server
mcp-servers:
  tavily:
    url: "https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=${{ secrets.TAVILY_API_KEY }}"
    allowed: ["*"]
network:
  allowed:
    - mcp.tavily.com
---
```

Consumers import it with `imports: [shared/mcp/tavily.md]`.

For Azure-based integrations, combine `shared/azure-auth.md` with Azure MCP
imports to preserve OIDC-backed Azure CLI auth inside the agent sandbox.
Azure DevOps MCP support (`shared/mcp/azure-devops.md`) is still experimental:

```aw wrap
---
imports:
  - uses: shared/azure-auth.md
    with:
      azure-client-id: ${{ vars.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
      azure-tenant-id: ${{ vars.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
  - uses: shared/mcp/azure-devops.md
    with:
      organization: YOUR_ORG
---
```

`shared/azure-auth.md` sets `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` to an agent-accessible path and
re-authenticates `az` in `pre-agent-steps`, which bridges auth across the
runner-to-sandbox process boundary. See
[Using MCPs](/gh-aw/guides/mcps/#azure-shared-imports-oidc-azure-devops-azure-mcp)
for network domains and read-only Azure MCP tool allowlist guidance.

### Importing MCP Gateway Settings

Shared workflow files can export `engine.mcp.tool-timeout` and `engine.mcp.session-timeout` without specifying an engine identifier; the importing workflow always provides the engine.

```aw title="shared/mcp/slow-backend.md" wrap
---
description: MCP gateway settings for slow-backend MCP servers
engine:
  mcp:
    tool-timeout: 5m     # Allow up to 5 minutes per tool call
    session-timeout: 2h  # Keep MCP sessions alive for long-running workflows
---
```

The importing workflow's own `engine.mcp` settings take precedence. Among imports, the first file that declares a value for a timeout wins.

### Importing Top-level `jobs:`

Top-level `jobs:` from a shared workflow are merged into the importing workflow's compiled lock file. Execution order is still determined by `needs`, so a shared job can run before or after other jobs in the final workflow:

```aw title="shared/build.md" wrap
---
description: Shared build job that compiles artifacts for the agent to inspect

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [activation]
    outputs:
      artifact_name: ${{ steps.build.outputs.artifact_name }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - name: Build
        id: build
        run: |
          npm ci && npm run build
          echo "artifact_name=build-output" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-output
          path: dist/

steps:
  - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: ${{ needs.build.outputs.artifact_name }}
      path: /tmp/build-output
---
```

Import it so the `build` job runs before the agent and its artifacts are available as pre-steps:

```aw title="my-workflow.md" wrap
---
on: pull_request
engine: copilot
imports:
  - shared/build.md
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
---

# Code Review Workflow

Review the build output in /tmp/build-output and suggest improvements.
```

In the compiled lock file, the `build` job appears alongside `activation` and `agent`, ordered by each job's `needs` declarations.

### Importing Jobs via `safe-outputs.jobs`

Jobs defined under `safe-outputs:` can be shared across workflows and become callable MCP tools during execution:

```aw title="shared/notify.md" wrap
---
description: Shared notification job
safe-outputs:
  notify-slack:
    description: "Post a message to Slack"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    output: "Notification sent"
    inputs:
      message:
        description: "Message to post"
        required: true
        type: string
    steps:
      - name: Post to Slack
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
        run: |
          curl -s -X POST "$SLACK_WEBHOOK" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d "{\"text\":\"${{ inputs.message }}\"}"
---
```

Consumers import it with `imports: [shared/notify.md]` and instruct the agent to call `notify-slack` when appropriate.

## Self-Contained Lock Files (`inlined-imports: true`)

Setting `inlined-imports: true` embeds all imported content directly into the compiled `.lock.yml` at compile time, producing a **self-contained** lock file that does not need file-system access or cross-repository checkout at runtime.

Enable it when runtime import resolution would otherwise fail, especially for:

- **Cross-organization `workflow_call`** runs, where the caller's `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot check out the callee repository's `.github` folder and Git returns `fatal: repository '...' not found`.
- **Repository rulesets**, where workflows running as [required status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets) cannot access other repo files and fail with `ERR_SYSTEM: Runtime import file not found`.

In both cases, bundling imports into the lock file at compile time avoids the runtime lookup:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  workflow_call:

engine: copilot

inlined-imports: true

imports:
  - shared/common-tools.md
  - shared/security-setup.md
---

# Platform Gateway Workflow

Workflow instructions here.
```

After adding the flag, recompile:

```bash
gh aw compile my-workflow
```

**Trade-off**: the compiled `.lock.yml` is larger because imported content is embedded inline.

> [!NOTE]
> With `inlined-imports: true`, any change to an imported file requires recompiling the workflow to take effect. The compiled `.lock.yml` must be committed and pushed for the updated content to run.
>
> `inlined-imports: true` cannot be combined with agent file imports (`.github/agents/` files). If your workflow imports a custom agent file, remove it before enabling inlined imports.
