title: QMD Documentation Search
description: Configure vector similarity search over documentation files using the qmd tool in agentic workflows.

QMD Documentation Search provides vector similarity search over documentation files. It runs [tobi/qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) as an MCP server so agents can find relevant documentation by natural language query.

The search index is built in a dedicated indexing job (which has `contents: read`) and shared with the agent job via GitHub Actions cache, so the agent job does not need `contents: read` permission.

:::caution[Experimental]
QMD Documentation Search is an experimental feature. The API may change in future releases.

## Basic Configuration

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  qmd:
    checkouts:
      - pattern: "docs/**/*.md"
---
```

## Configuration Options

### `checkouts`

A list of named documentation collections built from checked-out repositories. Each entry specifies which files to index from the current repository or a different repository.

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  qmd:
    checkouts:
      - pattern: "docs/**/*.md"
      - pattern: "README.md"
---
```

Each checkout entry can optionally specify its own checkout configuration to target a different repository.

### `searches`

A list of GitHub code search queries whose results are downloaded and added to the qmd index.

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  qmd:
    searches:
      - query: "repo:github/gh-aw language:markdown"
---
```

### `cache-key`

A GitHub Actions cache key used to persist the qmd index across workflow runs. When set without any indexing sources (`checkouts`/`searches`), qmd operates in read-only mode: the index is restored from cache and all indexing steps are skipped.

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  qmd:
    cache-key: "qmd-docs-${{ github.repository }}"
---
```

### `gpu`

Enable GPU acceleration for the embedding model (`node-llama-cpp`). Defaults to `false`: `NODE_LLAMA_CPP_GPU=false` is injected into the indexing step so GPU probing is skipped on CPU-only runners. Set to `true` only when the indexing runner has a GPU.

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  qmd:
    gpu: true
    runs-on: gpu-runner
---
```

### `runs-on`

Override the runner image for the qmd indexing job. Defaults to the same runner as the agent job. Use this when the indexing job requires a different runner (e.g. a GPU runner).

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  qmd:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
---
```

## Example: Index Documentation from Multiple Sources

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  qmd:
    checkouts:
      - pattern: "docs/**/*.md"
      - pattern: "*.md"
    cache-key: "qmd-docs-${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.run_id }}"
---
```

## Example: Read-Only Mode with Pre-Built Index

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  qmd:
    cache-key: "qmd-docs-my-project"
---
```

In read-only mode, the index is restored from cache and no indexing steps are run. This is useful when the index is built separately and shared across workflows.

## Telemetry

Use `otlp.cjs` in a shared import step to record qmd index size and search hits alongside the workflow's distributed trace.

```yaml wrap title=".github/workflows/shared/qmd-otlp.md"
---
# Shared import: emit qmd index size and search hit counts after the agent job.

steps:
  - name: Record qmd telemetry
    id: qmd-otlp
    uses: actions/github-script@v8
    with:
      script: |
        const fs   = require('fs');
        const otlp = require('/tmp/gh-aw/actions/otlp.cjs');

        // qmd writes index stats to /tmp/gh-aw/qmd/stats.json after indexing.
        let indexSize = 0;
        try {
          const stats = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/tmp/gh-aw/qmd/stats.json', 'utf8'));
          indexSize = stats.index_size ?? 0;
        } catch { /* index not available */ }

        // qmd appends one JSON line per query to /tmp/gh-aw/qmd/queries.jsonl.
        let hits = 0;
        try {
          const lines = fs.readFileSync('/tmp/gh-aw/qmd/queries.jsonl', 'utf8').trim().split('\n');
          hits = lines.reduce((sum, l) => {
            try { return sum + (JSON.parse(l).hits ?? 0); } catch { return sum; }
          }, 0);
        } catch { /* no queries yet */ }

        await otlp.logSpan('qmd', {
          'qmd.index.size':   indexSize,
          'qmd.search.hits':  hits,
        });
---
```

Import the shared file in any workflow that uses qmd:

```aw wrap
---
on: push

engine: copilot

imports:
  - shared/otlp.md   # sets OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
  - shared/qmd-otlp.md             # records index size and search hits

tools:
  qmd:
    checkouts:
      - pattern: "docs/**/*.md"
---
```
