This guide shows you how to debug agentic workflow failures on **github.com** using the Copilot CLI, the `gh aw` debugging commands, and manual investigation techniques.

> [!TIP]
> The fastest path to a fix is to let an AI agent debug it for you. Launch the Copilot CLI, invoke the `agentic-workflows` skill, and paste the failing run URL.

## Debugging with the Copilot CLI

The Copilot CLI is the recommended first step: it audits logs, traces failures, and suggests fixes interactively.

Launch `copilot`, invoke **agentic-workflows** to enable `gh aw audit`, `gh aw logs`, and related debugging tools. Then paste the failing run URL:

```text
Debug this workflow run: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID
```

Copilot downloads the logs, identifies the root cause (missing tools, permission errors, network blocks), and suggests fixes or opens a PR. Follow-up questions like "What domains were blocked?" or "Why did the MCP server fail?" work too.

### Alternative entry points

- **Copilot Chat on GitHub.com** (requires [agentic authoring setup](/gh-aw/guides/working-with-workflows/#configuring-your-repository-for-agentic-authoring)): `agentic-workflows debug <run-url>`
- **Any coding agent**: paste this prompt to install `gh aw` and run the standalone analysis:

  ```text
  Debug this workflow run using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/debug.md

  The failed workflow run is at https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID
  ```

## Debugging with CLI Commands

### Auditing a Specific Run

`gh aw audit` breaks down a single run — failure analysis and root cause, behavior fingerprint (network/tool/cost profile), tool usage, MCP server status, firewall analysis, token/cost metrics, and safe-outputs. Accepts a run ID, run URL, job URL (extracts first failing step), or step URL.

```bash
gh aw audit 12345678
gh aw audit https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/123/job/456#step:7:1
gh aw audit 12345678 --parse                          # parse to markdown
gh aw audit 12345678 12345679                         # compare two runs
gh aw audit 12345678 12345679 --format markdown
```

For security and performance trends across multiple runs, use `gh aw logs --format`:

```bash
gh aw logs my-workflow --format markdown --count 10
gh aw logs my-workflow --format markdown --last 5 --json
```

See [Audit Commands](/gh-aw/reference/audit/) for complete flag documentation.

### Analyzing Workflow Logs

`gh aw logs` downloads and analyzes logs across multiple runs (tool usage, network patterns, errors). Results are cached for 10–100× speedup on later runs.

```bash
gh aw logs my-workflow
gh aw logs my-workflow -c 10 --start-date -1w   # filter by count and date
gh aw logs my-workflow --firewall               # include firewall analysis
gh aw logs my-workflow --safe-output            # include safe-output details
gh aw logs my-workflow --json                   # JSON for scripting
```

### Checking Workflow Health

`gh aw health` reports workflow status across all workflows in a repository.

### Inspecting MCP Configuration

If you suspect MCP server issues, inspect the compiled configuration:

```bash
gh aw mcp list                              # list workflows with MCP servers
gh aw mcp inspect my-workflow               # inspect a workflow
gh aw mcp inspect my-workflow --inspector   # web-based inspector
```

## Common Errors

### "Authentication failed"

The Copilot token is missing, expired, or lacks the required permissions. Confirm you have an active Copilot subscription, that the token has **Copilot Requests** permission (fine-grained PATs), and that `gh auth status` reports it valid. See [Authentication Reference](/gh-aw/reference/auth/).

### "Tool not found" or Missing Tool Calls

The workflow references a tool that isn't configured or the MCP server failed to connect. Verify the `tools:` section in frontmatter, check the MCP server version, then run `gh aw mcp inspect my-workflow` and `gh aw audit <run-id>` to compare available vs. requested tools.

### Network / Firewall Blocks

```text
DENIED CONNECT registry.npmjs.org:443
```

The agent reached a domain outside the firewall allow-list. Add it explicitly, or use an ecosystem shorthand:

```aw
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - node        # npm, yarn, pnpm registries
    - python      # PyPI, conda registries
    - registry.npmjs.org
```

See [Network Configuration](/gh-aw/guides/network-configuration/) for common domain configurations.

### Safe-Outputs Not Creating Issues / Comments

The safe-outputs job failed, the agent didn't produce the expected output, or permissions are missing. Inspect the safe-outputs section in `gh aw audit <run-id>` and review the [Safe Outputs Reference](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/).

### Silent Long-running Commands After a Result

If the harness log says `post-result watchdog terminating idle process`, the agent already emitted a terminal safe output and then the child process went quiet. The watchdog is dormant until a terminal safe output such as `noop`, a comment, label, push, or pull request creation is observed; diagnostic outputs such as `missing_tool`, `missing_data`, and `report_incomplete` do not arm it. After arming, stdout or stderr activity resets the clock, so quiet builds, tests, or monorepo scans can be terminated even while they are still doing useful CPU or I/O work.

Increase `engine.harness.watchdog-timeout` for literal frontmatter values, or set `GH_AW_HARNESS_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_MS` when you need a millisecond environment-variable override. See [Harness Settings and Runtime Tuning Variables](/gh-aw/reference/environment-variables/#harness-settings-and-runtime-tuning-variables).

### Compilation Errors

The frontmatter has schema validation errors or unsupported fields. Use `--verbose` to diagnose, `gh aw fix --write` to auto-correct, and `--validate` to check without writing the lock file. See [Error Reference](/gh-aw/troubleshooting/errors/) for specific messages.

```bash
gh aw compile my-workflow --verbose
gh aw fix --write
gh aw compile --validate
```

## Advanced Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

`DEBUG` enables detailed internal logging for any `gh aw` command. Output goes to `stderr` — capture it with `2>&1 | tee debug.log`.

```bash
DEBUG=* gh aw compile my-workflow              # all logs
DEBUG=cli:* gh aw audit 12345678               # CLI-specific
DEBUG=workflow:*,cli:* gh aw compile           # multiple packages
```

### Enable GitHub API Request Logging

`gh aw` uses go-gh's native REST/GraphQL clients for many GitHub API calls. Setting `GH_DEBUG=api` prints verbose request/response details for calls made through those go-gh clients, with no extra flags needed:

```bash
GH_DEBUG=api gh aw compile my-workflow
```

### Enable GitHub Actions Debug Logging

Add an `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` repository secret set to `true` (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**), then re-run the workflow for verbose step-level logging in the Actions UI.

### Inspecting Firewall Logs

Workflow run artifacts include `sandbox/firewall/logs/access.log`. Each line shows allowed (`TCP_TUNNEL`) or blocked (`DENIED`) traffic:

```text
TCP_TUNNEL/200 api.github.com:443
DENIED CONNECT blocked-domain.com:443
```

Or use the CLI: `gh aw logs my-workflow --firewall`, or `gh aw audit <run-id>` for combined firewall analysis.

### Inspecting Artifacts

Workflow runs produce several artifacts useful for debugging:

| Artifact | Location | Contents |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `prompt.txt` | `/tmp/gh-aw/aw-prompts/` | Full prompt sent to the AI agent |
| `agent_output.json` | `/tmp/gh-aw/safeoutputs/` | Structured safe-output data |
| `agent-stdio.log` | `/tmp/gh-aw/` | Raw agent stdin/stdout log |
| `firewall-logs/` | `/tmp/gh-aw/firewall-logs/` | Network access logs |

Download from the Actions run page or `gh run download <run-id> --repo OWNER/REPO`.

### Recompiling for a Quick Fix

After editing the `.md` file, recompile, commit both files, and push:

```bash
gh aw compile my-workflow
git add .github/workflows/my-workflow.md .github/workflows/my-workflow.lock.yml
git commit -m "fix: update workflow configuration"
git push
```
