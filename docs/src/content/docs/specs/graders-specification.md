## Abstract

This specification defines the `graders` feature in gh-aw: deterministic execution metrics and operational-value results persisted as structured artifacts. It specifies configuration, built-in grader behavior, custom inline grader constraints, operational-value grader behavior, execution ordering, artifact outputs, experiment metric references, and conformance requirements.

## Status of This Document

This section describes the status of this document at the time of publication. This is a draft specification and may be updated, replaced, or made obsolete by other documents at any time.

This feature is experimental and implementations SHOULD expect iteration before final recommendation status.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The `graders` feature provides deterministic execution metrics and operational value observations without issuing additional LLM calls.

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers:

- Frontmatter configuration under `graders`
- Built-in grader identifiers and semantics
- Custom inline grader script requirements
- Operational-value evaluator requirements
- Output artifact contracts
- Experiment metric integration for grader references

This specification does NOT cover:

- Non-deterministic evaluator models
- UI visualization requirements
- External metric backends

### 1.3 Design Goals

A conforming implementation:

1. MUST compute grader values deterministically for the same request and observable evidence.
2. MUST preserve stable grader IDs for experiment references.
3. MUST keep trace grading isolated from network-dependent behavior.
4. MUST emit machine-readable grader artifacts for downstream tooling.

---

## 2. Conformance

### 2.1 Conformance Classes

- **Conforming implementation**: Satisfies all MUST/SHALL requirements in this document.
- **Partially conforming implementation**: Supports built-in graders but omits custom inline grader execution.

### 2.2 Requirements Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### 2.3 Compliance Levels

- **Level 1 (Required)**: Built-in graders, manifest/results output.
- **Level 2 (Standard)**: Custom inline graders with validation and isolation.
- **Level 3 (Complete)**: Experiment metric references to graders with validation.

---

## 3. Architecture

`graders` executes as a post-agent step in the existing `agent` job:

1. Parse and validate frontmatter `graders`.
2. Build grader manifest and execution spec.
3. Preprocess trace artifacts once.
4. Execute enabled graders (built-in, custom inline, and operational value).
5. Write normalized outputs to grader artifact files.

The grading step MUST run with `if: always()` semantics and SHOULD continue even when individual graders fail, recording per-grader errors in results.

---

## 4. Configuration Model

### 4.1 Frontmatter Key

The configuration key MUST be `graders`.

### 4.2 Enable/Disable Semantics

- If `graders` is omitted, grading MUST be disabled.
- If `graders: {}` is provided, all built-in graders MUST be enabled with defaults.
- If `graders` is present, at least one grader MUST be enabled; otherwise configuration MUST fail.

### 4.3 Entry Model

`graders` is a map of `<grader-id> -> <definition|null>`.

- Built-in grader entries MAY be `null` to enable defaults.
- Custom grader entries MUST be objects and MUST include `script`.
- The reserved `operational-value` entry MUST be an object and MUST include exactly one of `run` or `script`.

Supported object fields include `enabled`, `name`, `description`, `unit`, `direction`, `threshold`, `min`, `max`, `config`, `script`, and `run`. Only the reserved `operational-value` grader accepts `run`.

---

## 5. Built-in Graders

The implementation MUST recognize the following built-in grader IDs:

- `tool-success-rate`
- `tool-failure-count`
- `retries`
- `loops`
- `trajectory-efficiency`
- `execution-step-count`
- `execution-duration`
- `working-set-rebuild-factor`
- `context-growth`
- `artifact-production`

These IDs are reserved for built-ins. A built-in grader MUST NOT accept a custom `script`.

---

## 6. Custom Inline Graders

A custom grader is any grader ID not in the built-in set.

### 6.1 Required Fields

A custom grader MUST define `script`.

### 6.2 Script Limits

- `script` MUST be non-empty.
- `script` MUST NOT exceed 4096 characters.

### 6.3 Forbidden Patterns

Inline scripts MUST be rejected if they contain any forbidden pattern, including:

- `require(`
- `import(`
- `import `
- `fetch(`
- `eval(`
- `process.exit`
- `child_process`
- `execSync`
- `spawnSync`
- `Function(`

---

## 7. Operational Value Grader

The reserved grader ID MUST be `operational-value`. It MUST define exactly one evaluator source: inline Bash in `script`, or a repository-relative Bash file in `run`.

The grader SHOULD declare a concise `name`, `description`, `unit`, and `direction` for its primary metric. The evaluator SHOULD document the workflow intent and every emitted metric's native meaning, including its unit, direction, significant boundaries, and `null` interpretation, in source comments that are frozen with the evaluator bytes. The primary description MUST be retained in the grader manifest and serialized result when declared.

Both forms MUST be valid UTF-8, start with a Bash shebang, pass Bash syntax validation, and contain no more than 65,536 bytes. The compiler MUST resolve `run` within the repository and reject symlinks and non-regular files. It MUST freeze either source as exact evaluator bytes and record their SHA-256 digest in the grader manifest and result implementation.

The evaluator MUST run once with no mode arguments. It MUST read one JSON request from standard input containing `schemaVersion`, `run`, `event`, `outputs`, and `config`. `outputs` MUST contain the current run's validated safe-output requests and MUST NOT be treated as proof that requested GitHub mutations were applied. The evaluator MUST write exactly one non-empty ordered array of objects containing exactly `id` and `value`. IDs MUST be non-empty and unique. Values MUST be finite numbers or `null`. The first item is the primary metric; later items are diagnostics. The implementation MUST preserve numeric values exactly and MUST NOT normalize, clamp, rescale, or convert them to pass/fail. The declared `unit` and `direction` define how consumers interpret the native value.

The evaluator MUST return the same metric array for the same request and observable evidence. Missing or malformed required evidence MUST produce `null`, not zero. Historical replay, maturation, baselines, opportunity keys, evaluator definitions, provenance schemas, caches, and reports are outside this contract.

---

## 8. Execution and Artifacts

### 8.1 Output Directory

Graders output MUST be written under:

`/tmp/gh-aw/agent/graders`

### 8.2 Required Files

The implementation MUST produce:

- `grader_manifest.json`
- `grader_results.json`
- `operational_value_evaluator.sh` when the `operational-value` grader is enabled

### 8.3 Artifact Inclusion

All applicable files MUST be included in the unified `agent` artifact.

### 8.4 Deterministic Output Contract

`grader_results.json` SHOULD include normalized run/result structures suitable for downstream programmatic reads, including per-grader value/status and run-level pass/fail/error counts.

---

## 9. Experiment Metric References

Experiment metric fields MAY reference grader outputs.

Supported forms include:

- `grader:<id>`
- `graders.<id>.value`

When a grader reference is used, `<id>` MUST resolve to a declared enabled grader. Unknown or empty grader references MUST fail validation.

For each production run, the selected experiment variant is recorded before agent execution. The
post-agent grader result then becomes an observation attributed to that assignment:

```text
production run
→ grader result
→ experiment observation
→ statistical analysis
→ deterministic decision
```

`gh aw experiments analyze` reads the persisted assignment ledger and the run's
`grader_results.json`; this path does not require historical trace replay or an additional evaluator
model invocation. Only valid numeric grader results count toward `min_samples`. Missing artifacts,
missing or failed graders, and invalid values are excluded rather than treated as zero.

Grader `direction` determines whether lower or higher values are favorable. The experiment decision
layer normalizes this direction before applying its absolute `minimum_effect` policy and mandatory
guardrails. A grader measures only the behavior encoded by that grader; not every grader represents
semantic task correctness. The normative readiness, decision, and JSON contracts are defined in the
[Experiments Specification](/gh-aw/experimental/experiments-specification/#116-deterministic-decision-policy).

---

## 10. Security and Isolation

- Grading MUST operate on local run artifacts and MUST NOT require outbound network access for built-ins.
- Custom inline graders MUST execute in a restricted context with blocked dangerous primitives.
- Operational-value graders MAY access declared repository evidence using `GH_TOKEN`; implementations MUST NOT add agent-job permission scopes on behalf of the evaluator, and evaluators MUST NOT receive workflow secrets.
- Implementations SHOULD enforce bounded execution time for inline scripts.
- Implementations SHOULD redact grader outputs when custom scripts are enabled to reduce secret leakage risk.

---
