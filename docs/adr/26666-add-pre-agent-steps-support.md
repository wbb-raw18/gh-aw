## Part 1 — Narrative (Human-Friendly)

### Context

The gh-aw workflow compiler translates markdown workflow files into GitHub Actions YAML. It already supports two custom step extension points: `pre-steps` (injected before the checkout step, very early in the agent job) and `post-steps` (injected after AI engine execution). A gap exists for steps that must run after checkout, checkout cleanup, and PR/base restoration, but before MCP startup and later engine-owned runtime setup. Use cases include final context preparation scripts, last-moment environment variable injection, and validations that depend on checked-out code being available.

### Decision

We will add a new `pre-agent-steps` frontmatter field that is injected into the compiled GitHub Actions YAML after checkout cleanup and trusted base-restore steps, but before MCP startup and the later engine execution sequence. Like `pre-steps`, `pre-agent-steps` participates in the import merge system: imported `pre-agent-steps` are prepended before the main workflow's `pre-agent-steps`, preserving a deterministic, layered execution order. The existing `validateStepsSecrets` infrastructure is extended to cover the new field, applying identical secret expression restrictions.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Overload the existing `steps` field with ordering semantics

The existing `steps` field (custom steps) could be repurposed or extended with explicit positioning metadata (e.g., `position: before-engine`). This was rejected because `steps` already has a defined execution context and adding positional metadata would complicate both the schema and the compiler without providing a clearer mental model. A dedicated named field communicates intent more directly.

#### Alternative 2: Extend `pre-steps` with a phase option

`pre-steps` could accept an optional `phase: post-setup` attribute to signal late-bound execution. This was rejected because it conflates two very different lifecycle positions (before checkout vs. just before the engine) into a single field, making the execution model harder to reason about. Keeping phase-specific fields separate aligns with how GitHub Actions itself structures job steps.

#### Alternative 3: Require users to use `post-steps` with negated conditions

Users could approximate "run before engine" behaviour by placing steps in `post-steps` with `if: always()` or condition expressions that short-circuit. This is semantically backwards, error-prone to write, and would not actually execute *before* the AI engine — it would run after, defeating the use case entirely.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Users can inject pre-execution logic (context preparation, validation, environment mutations) at exactly the right lifecycle point — after setup, before the agent starts.
- The new field mirrors the naming and import-merge semantics of `pre-steps` and `post-steps`, keeping the mental model consistent and the feature discoverable.
- Secret expression validation is automatically enforced on the new field using the existing `validateStepsSecrets` infrastructure, preserving the security model without new code.
- Integration tests cover placement order (after force-clean-git-credentials, before engine execution) and import merge ordering.

#### Negative
- The workflow extension model now has three named step positions (`pre-steps`, `pre-agent-steps`, `post-steps`) plus the main `steps` field; the distinction between `pre-steps` and `pre-agent-steps` requires documentation to avoid confusion.
- Each new step type requires coordinated changes across the schema, type definitions, import extractor, compiler builder, YAML generator, serialization, and documentation — increasing the cost of future schema evolution.

#### Neutral
- The import merge ordering convention (imported steps prepend, main steps append) is the same as `pre-steps`; this is a neutral consistency consequence rather than a new design choice.
- The `docs/adr/` filename uses the PR number as the sequence identifier, consistent with existing ADR naming in this repository.

## Part 2 — Normative Specification (RFC 2119)

> The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this section are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

### Frontmatter Schema

1. Workflows **MAY** define a `pre-agent-steps` top-level frontmatter field containing an array of GitHub Actions step definitions.
2. The `pre-agent-steps` field **MUST** conform to the same step schema as `post-steps` (object or string items, with `additionalProperties: true`).
3. Implementations **MUST NOT** treat `pre-agent-steps` and `pre-steps` as interchangeable; they represent different lifecycle positions and **MUST** be processed independently.

### Compilation and Placement

1. Implementations **MUST** inject all resolved `pre-agent-steps` into the compiled GitHub Actions YAML immediately before the engine execution step.
2. `pre-agent-steps` **MUST** be placed after checkout cleanup and any trusted PR/base restoration steps, and **MUST** be placed before MCP startup and the later engine execution sequence.
3. If no `pre-agent-steps` are defined (neither in the main workflow nor in any imports), the compiler **MUST NOT** emit any placeholder or empty steps block.

### Import Merge Ordering

1. When a workflow imports other workflows that also define `pre-agent-steps`, implementations **MUST** prepend imported `pre-agent-steps` before the main workflow's `pre-agent-steps` in the merged output.
2. Import merge order **MUST** follow the same topological ordering used for all other merged fields.

### Secret Expression Validation

1. Implementations **MUST** apply secret expression validation to the `pre-agent-steps` field using the same rules applied to `pre-steps`, `steps`, and `post-steps`.
2. In strict mode, secrets expressions in non-`env`/`with` contexts within `pre-agent-steps` **MUST** cause a compilation error.
3. In non-strict mode, secrets expressions in `pre-agent-steps` **SHOULD** emit a warning.

### Action Pinning

1. Implementations **MUST** apply action pin resolution (SHA substitution) to `uses:` references in `pre-agent-steps`, consistent with how pinning is applied to `pre-steps` and `post-steps`.

### Conformance

An implementation is considered conformant with this ADR if it satisfies all **MUST** and **MUST NOT** requirements above. Specifically: `pre-agent-steps` are injected after checkout cleanup / trusted restore steps and before MCP startup and engine execution, imports are merged in prepend order, secret validation is applied, and action pinning is applied. Failure to meet any **MUST** or **MUST NOT** requirement constitutes non-conformance.
