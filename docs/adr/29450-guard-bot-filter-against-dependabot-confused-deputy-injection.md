## Part 1 — Narrative (Human-Friendly)

### Context

Every compiled gh-aw workflow runs a `pre_activation` job that executes two JavaScript checks before the agent starts: `check_membership.cjs`, which verifies that `github.actor` holds the required repository permission (or appears in the bot allowlist), and `check_skip_bots.cjs`, which suppresses the workflow when `github.actor` is in the workflow's `skip-bots` list. Both scripts treated `github.actor` — the account that *triggered* the run — as the sole identity signal, without verifying that the triggering account is also the account that *authored* the underlying pull request or comment. GitHub Actions sets `github.actor` to whichever account caused the most-recent workflow trigger, which can differ from the PR author when a third party (such as Dependabot) reacts to a comment on a fork PR. This discrepancy is exploitable via the [Dependabot Confused Deputy Injection](https://labs.boostsecurity.io/articles/weaponizing-dependabot-pwn-request-at-its-finest/) technique, where an attacker manipulates Dependabot into re-triggering a run with `actor = dependabot[bot]` so that the actor's elevated permissions — not the attacker's — are used for the permission check, causing the agent to execute against the attacker's untrusted code.

### Decision

We will introduce a `isConfusedDeputyAttack(actor, eventName, payload)` pure helper in `check_permissions_utils.cjs` that detects when `github.actor` does not match the event-specific author field in the webhook payload. For `pull_request` events, the check is intentionally scoped to the `synchronize` action **and to bot actors only** (logins ending with `[bot]`) — the documented attack vector requires a bot actor, and restricting to bots prevents false positives when a human team member pushes commits to a PR they did not open (legitimate collaboration). For `pull_request_review` events, the check compares against `payload.review.user.login` (the reviewer). For `pull_request_review_comment` and `issue_comment` events, the check compares against `payload.comment.user.login` (the comment author). For all other event types the helper returns `false`. `check_membership.cjs` will call this helper immediately before the `checkRepositoryPermission` call and deny any run where the check returns `true`. `check_skip_bots.cjs` will call the same helper after the "no skip-bots" early return and, if a confused deputy is detected, will *not* suppress the workflow — allowing the run to proceed to `check_membership.cjs` where it will be denied explicitly rather than silently skipped. In addition, the compiled condition for the `"dependabot pull request"` trigger shorthand in `trigger_parser.go` will be tightened from `github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'` to `github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]' && github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'dependabot[bot]'`, ensuring the shorthand only activates when the PR was genuinely authored by Dependabot.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Allowlist-Only Defence (Opt-In per Repository)

Restrict `dependabot[bot]` to the bot allowlist only for repositories that explicitly opt in, requiring a configuration change for any repo that wants Dependabot PRs handled by the agent. This was rejected because it places the security burden on individual repository owners, does not address the `skip-bots` bypass variant (where the attacker impersonates Dependabot to suppress the workflow for their own PR), and still leaves unenrolled repositories vulnerable. It also provides no protection for `issue_comment` or `pull_request_review` confused-deputy variants.

#### Alternative 2: Use `GITHUB_TRIGGERING_ACTOR` Instead of `github.actor`

Replace all references to `github.actor` with the `GITHUB_TRIGGERING_ACTOR` environment variable, which GitHub sets to the account that initiated a re-run. This was rejected because `GITHUB_TRIGGERING_ACTOR` is only populated during re-run scenarios; it is absent for the original confused-deputy trigger (the first run that Dependabot initiates in response to a comment), making it an incomplete defence.

#### Alternative 3: Deny All `[bot]`-Suffixed Actors on PR Events

Reject any actor whose login ends in `[bot]` for `pull_request` and related events. This was rejected because legitimate bot-authored PRs — from Renovate, automated release tooling, or custom GitHub Apps — should remain functional without per-repository exemption lists, and the blanket denial would break those workflows.

#### Alternative 4: Compile-Time Fix Only (`trigger_parser.go`)

Tighten only the `"dependabot pull request"` compiled condition and make no runtime changes to `check_membership.cjs` or `check_skip_bots.cjs`. This was rejected because the compile-time condition protects only that specific trigger shorthand; it leaves `check_membership.cjs` vulnerable whenever the workflow's activation condition passes through a path other than the `"dependabot pull request"` shorthand, and it provides no coverage for `issue_comment` or `pull_request_review` events.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Closes the confused deputy attack vector for `pull_request`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request_review`, and `pull_request_review_comment` events without any per-repository configuration change.
- The `"dependabot pull request"` trigger shorthand is made safe at compile time independently of the runtime check, providing defence-in-depth.
- `workflow_call`, `push`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`, and `merge_group` events are entirely unaffected: `isConfusedDeputyAttack` returns `false` for all of them, producing no false positives.
- The confused deputy result is surfaced as an explicit `core.warning` and written to the job summary, making attacks visible in workflow logs rather than silently ignored.

#### Negative
- The `pull_request:synchronize` guard is restricted to bot actors (logins ending with `[bot]`), so legitimate bot scenarios where a bot force-pushes to a PR it did not open (e.g., an automated rebase bot) would be denied. Such bots should open their own PRs rather than rebasing others' PRs; if they do not, they would need to be exempted via the bot allowlist. Human team members pushing commits to another user's PR are unaffected and continue to be validated by their own repository permissions.
- `check_permissions_utils.cjs` gains a new export (`isConfusedDeputyAttack`) and both `check_membership.cjs` and `check_skip_bots.cjs` gain a new import and call-site, modestly increasing the size and coupling of the pre-activation check surface.

#### Neutral
- The guard runs exclusively in the `pre_activation` job; the agent execution job is structurally unchanged.
- The `isConfusedDeputyAttack` function performs no network I/O and adds negligible latency to the pre-activation job.
- Existing compiled workflows do not need to be recompiled; the protection takes effect as soon as the updated `actions/setup/js/` helpers are deployed, because the JavaScript files are copied to `/tmp/gh-aw/actions` at runtime rather than embedded in compiled lock files.

## Part 2 — Normative Specification (RFC 2119)

> The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this section are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

### `isConfusedDeputyAttack` Helper

1. The `check_permissions_utils.cjs` module **MUST** export a pure function named `isConfusedDeputyAttack(actor, eventName, payload)` that returns a boolean.
2. For `pull_request` events, the function **MUST** return `true` if and only if `payload.action` strictly equals `"synchronize"` **and** `actor` ends with `"[bot]"` **and** `actor` does not strictly equal `payload.pull_request.user.login`. The bot restriction is required because a human team member pushing commits to a PR they did not open is legitimate collaboration and **MUST NOT** be flagged. For all other `pull_request` actions (e.g., `labeled`, `unlabeled`, `opened`, `assigned`, `review_requested`), the function **MUST** return `false`, because for those actions the actor is legitimately the person who performed the action rather than the PR author.
3. For `pull_request_review` events, the function **MUST** return `true` if and only if `actor` does not strictly equal `payload.review.user.login`.
4. For `pull_request_review_comment` events, the function **MUST** return `true` if and only if `actor` does not strictly equal `payload.comment.user.login`.
5. For `issue_comment` events, the function **MUST** return `true` if and only if `actor` does not strictly equal `payload.comment.user.login`.
6. For all other event types (`push`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`, `workflow_call`, `merge_group`, etc.), the function **MUST** return `false`.
7. If the event-specific author field is absent or `undefined` in the payload for an otherwise-covered event type, the function **MUST** return `false` to avoid false positives.
8. The function **MUST NOT** perform any network I/O, file I/O, or external side effects.

### Membership Check (`check_membership.cjs`)

1. After the safe-events bypass and before any call to `checkRepositoryPermission`, `check_membership.cjs` **MUST** call `isConfusedDeputyAttack` with the current `github.actor`, `github.event_name`, and `github.event` payload.
2. If `isConfusedDeputyAttack` returns `true`, the membership check **MUST** set `result` to `confused_deputy`, set `is_team_member` to `false`, emit a `core.warning` identifying the actor mismatch, write a denial summary to the job summary, and **MUST NOT** proceed to `checkRepositoryPermission`.
3. A run denied with `result = confused_deputy` **MUST** be treated identically to a `no_permission` denial by all downstream consumers of the `result` output.

### Skip-Bots Check (`check_skip_bots.cjs`)

1. After the "no skip-bots configured" early return and before the skip-bots matching loop, `check_skip_bots.cjs` **MUST** call `isConfusedDeputyAttack` with the current actor, event name, and payload.
2. If `isConfusedDeputyAttack` returns `true`, `check_skip_bots.cjs` **MUST** set `skip_bots_ok` to `true`, set `result` to `not_skipped`, and return immediately — **MUST NOT** suppress the workflow — so that the run proceeds to `check_membership.cjs` where it will be denied with an explicit result.
3. `check_skip_bots.cjs` **MUST NOT** suppress the workflow solely because `github.actor` appears in the `skip-bots` list when the confused deputy check has fired; suppressing at this stage **MUST NOT** be used as a substitute for the explicit denial in `check_membership.cjs`.

### Dependabot Pull Request Trigger Shorthand

1. The compiled condition for the `"dependabot pull request"` trigger shorthand **MUST** be `github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]' && github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'dependabot[bot]'`.
2. Implementations **MUST NOT** emit a condition that checks only `github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'` without the corresponding `pull_request.user.login` guard for this shorthand.

### Conformance

An implementation is considered conformant with this ADR if it satisfies all **MUST** and **MUST NOT** requirements above. Failure to meet any **MUST** or **MUST NOT** requirement constitutes non-conformance.
