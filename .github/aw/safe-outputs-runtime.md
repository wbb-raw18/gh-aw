# Safe Outputs: Runtime and Extensibility

See [jobs.md](jobs.md) for the full compiler-generated job graph and which job each credential (`github-token`, `github-app`) configures.

The `report-incomplete` safe-output is enabled by default and is distinct from `noop`. Use it when required tools or data are unavailable and the task cannot be meaningfully performed (e.g., MCP server crash, missing authentication, inaccessible repository). When an agent emits `report_incomplete`, gh-aw activates failure handling even when the agent process exits 0 — preventing empty outputs from being classified as successful, so every unrecoverable failure is tracked.

**Per-handler modifiers** — most handlers accept `max`, `github-token`, `github-app`, and `staged` to override the global equivalents for that one output type. Two extras:

- `issue-intent:` (boolean) on `close-issue`, `set-issue-type`, `set-issue-field`, `assign-to-user`, and `assign-to-agent` — enables issue-intent metadata (rationale/confidence/suggest) fields and their schema requirements on that tool's payload.
- `normalize-closing-keywords:` (boolean) on body-carrying handlers (`create-issue`, `add-comment`, `create-pull-request`, …) — strips backticks around recognized issue-closing keywords so they stay active.

- `jobs:` - Custom safe-output jobs registered as MCP tools for third-party integrations

  ```yaml
  safe-outputs:
    jobs:
      send-notification:
        description: "Send a notification to an external service"
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        output: "Notification sent successfully!"
        inputs:
          message:
            description: "The message to send"
            required: true
            type: string
        permissions:
          contents: read
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
        steps:
          - name: Send notification
            run: |
              MESSAGE=$(cat "$GH_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" | jq -r '.items[] | select(.type == "send_notification") | .message')
              curl -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" -d "$MESSAGE" https://api.example.com/notify
  ```

  Post-processing GitHub Actions jobs registered as MCP tools. Agents call the tool by its normalized name (dashes → underscores, e.g., `send_notification`). The job runs after the agent completes with access to `$GH_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT` (agent output JSON path). Use to integrate Slack, Discord, external APIs, databases, or any service requiring secrets. Import from shared files via `imports:`.

- `scripts:` - Inline JavaScript handlers running inside the safe-outputs job handler loop

  ```yaml
  safe-outputs:
    scripts:
      post-slack-message:
        description: "Post a message to Slack"
        inputs:
          channel:
            description: "Target Slack channel"
            type: string
            default: "#general"
        script: |
          // 'channel' is available from config inputs; 'item' contains runtime message values
          await fetch(process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({ text: item.message, channel })
          });
  ```

  Unlike `jobs:` (which create separate GitHub Actions jobs), scripts execute in-process alongside built-in handlers. Write only the handler body — the compiler generates the outer wrapper with config input destructuring and `async function handleX(item, resolvedTemporaryIds) { ... }`. Script names with dashes are normalized to underscores (e.g., `post-slack-message` → `post_slack_message`). The handler receives `item` (runtime message with input values) and `resolvedTemporaryIds` (map of temporary IDs).

- `actions:` - Custom GitHub Actions mounted as MCP tools for the AI agent (resolved at compile time)

  ```yaml
  safe-outputs:
    actions:
      my-action:
        uses: owner/repo/path@ref         # Required: GitHub Action reference (tag, SHA, or branch)
        description: "Custom description" # Optional: override action's description from action.yml
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }} # Optional: environment variables for the injected step
  ```

  Resolved at compile time — the compiler fetches `action.yml`, parses inputs, and exposes them as MCP tool parameters. The agent calls the action by its normalized name (dashes → underscores). Each action runs as an injected step in the safe-outputs job. Local actions (`./path/to/action`) are also supported.

**Global Safe Output Configuration:**
- `github-token:` - Custom GitHub token for all safe output jobs

  ```yaml
  safe-outputs:
    create-issue:
    add-comment:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_AW_SAFE_OUTPUTS_TOKEN }}  # Use custom PAT instead of GITHUB_TOKEN
  ```

  Useful when you need additional permissions or want to perform actions across repositories.
- `urls:` - URL sanitization policy for safe output content (string)
  - `allowed-only` (default) - sanitize all non-allowed URLs everywhere
  - `allowed-or-code-region` - preserve URLs inside fenced and inline code regions while sanitizing prose
- `allowed-domains:` - Allowed domains for URLs in safe output content (array)
  - URLs from unlisted domains are replaced with `(redacted)`
  - GitHub domains are always included by default
- `data:` - Structured data configuration for body-based safe outputs (boolean, object, or GitHub Actions expression)
  - Applies to `create-issue`, `add-comment`, `create-pull-request`, `create-pull-request-review-comment`, `submit-pull-request-review`, and `reply-to-pull-request-review-comment`
  - `false` or omitted (default) - no structured `data` field accepted
  - `true` - accept any object as the `data` field alongside `body`
  - Inline schema object - enforce shape; supports full JSON Schema keywords (`type`, `properties`, `required`, `items`, `enum`, etc.) or shorthand (`{ verdict: string, score: number }`)
  - `${{ ... }}` expression - resolves to one of the above at runtime
  - Example:

    ```yaml
    safe-outputs:
      data:
        verdict: string
        score: number
      add-comment:
    ```
- `allowed-github-references:` - Allowed repositories for GitHub-style references (array)
  - Controls which GitHub references (`#123`, `owner/repo#456`) are allowed in workflow output
  - References to unlisted repositories are escaped with backticks to prevent timeline items
  - Configuration options:
    - `[]` - Escape all references (prevents all timeline items)
    - `["repo"]` - Allow only the target repository's references
    - `["repo", "owner/other-repo"]` - Allow specific repositories
    - Not specified (default) - All references allowed
  - Example:

    ```yaml
    safe-outputs:
      allowed-github-references: []  # Escape all references
      create-issue:
        target-repo: "my-org/main-repo"
    ```

    With `[]`, references like `#123` become `` `#123` `` and `other/repo#456` becomes `` `other/repo#456` ``, preventing timeline clutter while preserving information.
- `messages:` - Custom message templates for safe-output footer and notification messages (object)
  - Available placeholders: `{workflow_name}`, `{run_url}`, `{agentic_workflow_url}`, `{triggering_number}`, `{triggering_type}`, `{workflow_source}`, `{workflow_source_url}`, `{operation}`, `{event_type}`, `{status}`, `{ai_credits}`, `{ai_credits_formatted}`, `{ai_credits_suffix}`
  - Message types:
    - `footer:` - Custom footer for AI-generated content
    - `footer-install:` - Installation instructions appended to footer
    - `footer-workflow-recompile:` - Footer for workflow recompile tracking issues (placeholder: `{repository}`)
    - `footer-workflow-recompile-comment:` - Footer for comments on workflow recompile issues (placeholder: `{repository}`)
    - `run-started:` - Workflow activation notification
    - `run-success:` - Successful completion message
    - `run-failure:` - Failure notification message
    - `detection-failure:` - Detection job failure message
    - `agent-failure-issue:` - Footer for agent failure tracking issues
    - `agent-failure-comment:` - Footer for comments on agent failure tracking issues
    - `staged-title:` - Staged mode preview title
    - `staged-description:` - Staged mode preview description
    - `append-only-comments:` - Create new comments instead of editing existing ones (boolean, default: false)
    - `pull-request-created:` - Custom message when a PR is created. Placeholders: `{item_number}`, `{item_url}`
    - `issue-created:` - Custom message when an issue is created. Placeholders: `{item_number}`, `{item_url}`
    - `commit-pushed:` - Custom message when a commit is pushed. Placeholders: `{commit_sha}`, `{short_sha}`, `{commit_url}`
    - `body-header:` - Custom header text prepended to every message body (issues, comments, PRs, discussions). Placeholders: `{workflow_name}`, `{run_url}`
    - `disclosure-header:` - AI authorship disclosure header prepended to every message body. Set to `"true"` for built-in default text, or provide a custom template string. Placeholders: `{workflow_name}`, `{run_url}`
  - Example:

    ```yaml
    safe-outputs:
      messages:
        append-only-comments: true
        footer: "> Generated by [{workflow_name}]({run_url})"
        run-started: "[{workflow_name}]({run_url}) started processing this {event_type}."
    ```

- `mentions:` - Configuration for @mention filtering in safe outputs (boolean or object)
  - Boolean format: `false` - Always escape mentions; `true` - Always allow (error in strict mode)
  - Object format for fine-grained control:

    ```yaml
    safe-outputs:
      mentions:
        allowed-collaborators: true # Allow repository collaborators (default: true; `allow-team-members` is a deprecated alias)
        allow-context: true          # Allow mentions from event context (default: true)
        allowed: [copilot, user1]    # Always allow specific users/bots
        allowed-teams:               # Allow all members of named GitHub teams
          - myorg/eng                # org/team-slug format (cross-org)
          - reviewers                # bare team-slug (uses current repo's org)
        max: 50                      # Maximum mentions per message (default: 50)
    ```

  - Team members include collaborators with any permission level (excluding bots unless explicitly listed)
  - Context mentions include issue/PR authors, assignees, and commenters
  - `allowed-teams` resolves team membership from the GitHub API at runtime; bot accounts are excluded. Use `org/team-slug` for cross-org teams or a bare `team-slug` to resolve against the current repository's organization.
  - **`allowed-teams` requires `read:org` scope.** The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does **not** include this scope. Provide a classic PAT with `read:org`, a fine-grained PAT with the "Members" permission (read), or a GitHub App installation token with the "Members" permission (read) via `safe-outputs.github-token:` or `safe-outputs.github-app:`. If the token lacks the required scope, team lookup fails with a warning and the workflow continues without those team members in the allowlist.
- `runs-on:` - Runner specification for all safe-outputs jobs (string)
  - Defaults to `ubuntu-slim` (1-vCPU runner)
  - Examples: `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `self-hosted`
  - Applies to activation, create-issue, add-comment, and other safe-output jobs
- `footer:` - Global footer control for all safe outputs (boolean, default: `true`)
  - When `false`, omits visible AI-generated footer content from all created/updated entities (issues, PRs, discussions, releases) while still including XML markers for searchability
  - Individual safe-output types can override this setting
- `body-footer:` - Deterministic template appended to every body-producing safe output, additive with any handler-specific `body-footer:` (string)
  - Appended even when `footer: false` omits the AI-generated footer
- `staged:` - Preview mode for all safe outputs (boolean)
  - When `true`, emits step summary messages instead of making GitHub API calls; useful for testing without side effects
- `env:` - Environment variables passed to all safe output jobs (object)
  - Values typically reference secrets: `MY_VAR: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`
- `steps:` - Custom steps injected into all safe-output jobs, running after repository checkout and before safe-output code (array)
  - Useful for installing dependencies or performing setup needed by safe-output logic
  - Example:

    ```yaml
    safe-outputs:
      steps:
        - name: Install custom dependencies
          run: npm install my-package
      create-issue:
    ```

- `steer:` - **Experimental.** Create a run-scoped issue during activation, before the agent starts, so users can steer the run via comments containing the keyword `steer` (boolean, default: `false`)
  - Requires top-level `issues: read` permission (compiler errors instead of auto-adding it) and enables the GitHub MCP issues toolset for comment reads
  - Activation/conclusion jobs need `issues: write` through the global `github-token` or `github-app` safe-output credential; on success the conclusion job closes the issue and links a created PR, on failure it retitles and updates the same issue instead of creating a second one
  - Cannot be combined with `failure-issue-repo`; no steering issue is created in staged mode
- `max-bot-mentions:` - Maximum bot trigger references (e.g. `@copilot`, `@github-actions`) allowed in output before all excess are escaped with backticks (integer or expression, default: 10)
  - Set to `0` to escape all bot trigger phrases
  - Example: `max-bot-mentions: 3`
- `activation-comments:` - Disable all activation and fallback comments (boolean or expression, default: `true`)
  - When `false`, disables run-started, run-success, run-failure, and PR/issue creation link comments
  - Supports templatable boolean: `false`, `true`, or GitHub Actions expressions like `${{ inputs.activation-comments }}`

**Templatable Integer Fields**: The `max`, `expires`, and `max-bot-mentions` fields (and most other numeric/boolean fields) accept GitHub Actions expression strings in addition to literal values, enabling runtime-configured limits:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  max-bot-mentions: ${{ inputs.max-mentions }}
  create-issue:
    max: ${{ inputs.max-issues }}
    expires: ${{ inputs.expires-days }}
```

Fields that influence permission computation (`add-comment.discussions`, `hide-comment.discussions`, `create-pull-request.fallback-as-issue`) remain literal booleans.

- `timeout-minutes:` - Timeout for the safe-outputs job in minutes (integer, default: `45`)
  - Increase for workflows with many sequential safe-output operations (e.g. `push-to-pull-request-branch` against large repositories)
- `max-patch-size:` - Maximum allowed git patch size in kilobytes (integer, default: 4096 KB = 4 MB)
  - Patches exceeding this size are rejected to prevent accidental large changes
- `max-patch-files:` - Maximum allowed number of unique files in a create-pull-request patch (integer, default: 100)
  - Counts unique file paths deduplicated across multi-commit patches; reflects how many distinct files the agent is pushing per iteration
  - Increase this limit for long-running branches that touch many files
- `group-reports:` - Group workflow failure reports as sub-issues (boolean, default: `false`)
  - When `true`, creates a parent `[aw] Failed runs` issue that tracks all workflow failures as sub-issues; useful for larger repositories
- `report-failure-as-issue:` - Control whether workflow failures are reported as GitHub issues (boolean, expression, or category array; default: `true`)
  - When `false`, suppresses automatic failure issue creation for this workflow
  - Supports templatable boolean expressions, e.g. `report-failure-as-issue: ${{ inputs.report-failure-as-issue }}`
  - Use to silence noisy failure reports for workflows where failures are expected or handled externally
- `failure-issue-repo:` - Repository to create failure tracking issues in (string, format: `"owner/repo"`)
  - Defaults to the current repository when not specified
  - Use when the current repository has issues disabled: `failure-issue-repo: "myorg/infra-alerts"`
- `report-failed-jobs:` - Controls whether failed non-builtin jobs (custom `jobs:` entries) are reported as issues (boolean, default: `true`)
  - Set to `false` to disable failure-issue creation for custom job failures while keeping agent-failure reporting
- `id-token:` - Override the id-token permission for the safe-outputs job (string: `"write"` or `"none"`)
  - `"write"`: force-enable `id-token: write` permission (required for OIDC authentication with cloud providers)
  - `"none"`: suppress automatic detection and prevent adding `id-token: write` even when vault/OIDC actions are detected in steps
  - Default: auto-detects known OIDC/vault actions (e.g., `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`, `azure/login`, `hashicorp/vault-action`) and adds `id-token: write` automatically
- `concurrency-group:` - Concurrency group for the safe-outputs job (string)
  - When set, the safe-outputs job uses this concurrency group with `cancel-in-progress: false`
  - Supports GitHub Actions expressions, e.g., `"safe-outputs-${{ github.repository }}"`
- `needs:` - Additional custom workflow jobs the safe-outputs job depends on (array)
  - Example: `needs: [secrets_fetcher]`
  - Use when the safe-outputs job requires outputs from a custom job defined in `jobs:`
- `environment:` - Override the GitHub deployment environment for the safe-outputs job (string)
  - Defaults to the top-level `environment:` field when not specified
  - Use when the main job and safe-outputs job need different deployment environments for protection rules
- `github-app:` - GitHub App credentials for minting installation access tokens (object)
  - When configured, generates a token from the app and uses it for all safe output operations (alternative to `github-token`)
  - Fields:
    - `client-id:` - GitHub App client ID (required, e.g., `${{ vars.APP_ID }}`). Use `app-id:` for legacy compatibility.
    - `private-key:` - GitHub App private key (required, e.g., `${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}`)
    - `owner:` - Optional App installation owner (defaults to current repository owner)
    - `repositories:` - Optional list of repositories to grant access to
    - `ignore-if-missing:` - When `true`, skip token minting instead of failing when `client-id`/`private-key` resolve empty (boolean, default: `false`)
    - `permissions:` - Optional map of extra `permission-*` fields to merge into the minted token
  - Example:

    ```yaml
    safe-outputs:
      github-app:
        client-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
        private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      create-issue:
    ```

- `threat-detection:` - Threat detection configuration (auto-enabled for all safe-outputs workflows)
  - Automatically enabled by default; customizable via explicit configuration
  - Fields:
    - `enabled:` - Enable/disable threat detection (boolean or expression, default: `true`)
    - `prompt:` - Additional instructions appended to threat detection analysis (string)
    - `engine:` - AI engine for threat detection (engine config or `false` to disable AI detection)
    - `steps:` - Extra job steps to run before engine execution (array)
    - `post-steps:` - Extra job steps to run after engine execution (array)
    - `max-ai-credits:` - Per-run AIC budget for the detection engine (numeric only, no expressions; default `${{ vars.GH_AW_DEFAULT_DETECTION_MAX_AI_CREDITS || '400' }}`)
    - `runs-on:` - Runner override for the detection job (defaults to `agent.runs-on`)
    - `continue-on-error:` - When `true` (default), detection failures emit a warning and proceed with a `needs-review` label; when `false`, failures block safe outputs (boolean or expression)
    - `report-as-issue:` - When `true` (default), detection warnings/failures create or update the `[aw] Detection Runs` tracking issue; set `false` to keep detection and its enforcement active while skipping the tracking issue (results stay visible in Actions run diagnostics) (boolean)
  - Example to disable AI-based detection (use custom steps only):

    ```yaml
    safe-outputs:
      threat-detection:
        engine: false
        steps:
          - name: Custom check
            run: echo "Custom threat check"
    ```


## Output Variables

The safe-outputs job emits named step outputs for the first successful result of each type:

| Safe Output | Step Output Variables |
|---|---|
| `create-issue` | `created_issue_number`, `created_issue_url` |
| `create-pull-request` | `created_pr_number`, `created_pr_url` |
| `add-comment` | `comment_id`, `comment_url` |
| `push-to-pull-request-branch` | `push_commit_sha`, `push_commit_url` |
