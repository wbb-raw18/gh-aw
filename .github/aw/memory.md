# Persistent Memory in Agentic Workflows

For workflows that **persist state across runs** — deduplication, incremental processing, cross-run context, or knowledge accumulation.

> ⚠️ **`repo-memory` is NOT a synonym for `cache-memory`**. Different backends, different tradeoffs. `cache-memory` is almost always the right first choice.

---

## Quick Decision Guide

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Skip already-processed items (deduplication) | `cache-memory` ✅ first choice |
| Round-robin processing across runs | `cache-memory` ✅ first choice |
| Store ephemeral run state, analysis notes, or intermediate results | `cache-memory` ✅ first choice |
| Track a numeric metric and compare current vs. baseline (runs at least every 7 days) | `cache-memory` ✅ first choice |
| Long-lived knowledge base visible in PRs and code reviews | `repo-memory` |
| Baselines that must survive cache expiry (e.g. security findings, dedup lists) | `repo-memory` |
| Human-readable wiki pages for knowledge accumulation | `repo-memory` with `wiki: true` |
| Persist notes/state inline on the triggering issue or PR | `comment-memory` |
| Private-preview GitHub Drives backend (enrolled repos only) | `drive-memory` — see [drive-memory.md](drive-memory.md) |

**Default to `cache-memory` unless you have a specific reason to use `repo-memory`.** Do not suggest `drive-memory` unless the repository is confirmed enrolled in the GitHub Drives private preview.

## Built-in Memory via GitHub Graph and Git History

Before writing new persistent files, check whether GitHub and Git already expose the state you need.

### Practical strategies

| Goal | Built-in source | Caching strategy |
|---|---|---|
| Skip stale files in docs/code scans | Git history (`git log` / last modified commit per file) | Cache a repo watermark SHA or per-file SHAs; compare changed paths in newer commits |
| Avoid reopening known incidents | Issue/PR history (open + closed by label/title prefix) | Cache only canonical identifiers (issue numbers, advisory IDs) |
| Process incrementally across repo activity | PR merge history (`merged_at`, base branch) | Cache last merged PR number/timestamp; fetch only newer merges |
| Keep nightly triage focused | Issue timeline (`updated_at`, comments) | Cache last scan cursor (`updated_at` watermark); inspect only newer updates |
| Reuse expensive relationship lookups | GitHub graph links (issue ↔ PR ↔ commit) | Cache normalized link maps keyed by stable node IDs |

### Design guidance

- Prefer **stable identifiers** (`node_id`, issue/PR number, commit SHA) over mutable text.
- Persist **watermarks** (timestamp, commit SHA, PR number) instead of full snapshots.
- Treat built-in history as source of truth; store only incremental resume state.
- For cheap bounded queries (latest 20-100 items), recompute from GitHub/git instead of storing derived datasets.

## `cache-memory` — First Choice

GitHub Actions cache (`actions/cache`) persisting `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/` via `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` MCP.

### When to use

- **Deduplication**: track processed items (issues, PRs, URLs, IDs)
- **Round-robin / incremental**: remember position across scheduled runs
- **Ephemeral structured state**: JSON blobs, queues, intermediate results
- **Metric baseline comparison**: store coverage/score/count, compare next run (see [Stateful Analysis](#stateful-analysis--baseline-comparison))
- **Visual regression baselines**: screenshots between PR runs (see `visual-regression.md`)
- **Tool call caching**: avoid redundant API calls

### Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  cache-memory: true
```

Custom key:

```yaml
tools:
  cache-memory:
    key: dedup-${{ github.event.schedule }}-${{ github.run_id }}
    retention-days: 30
    allowed-extensions: [".json"]
```

Multiple named caches:

```yaml
tools:
  cache-memory:
    - id: processed
      key: processed-items-${{ github.run_id }}
    - id: results
      key: results-${{ github.run_id }}
      retention-days: 14
```

### Custom validation

For domain-specific constraints beyond `allowed-extensions` (schema checks, cross-file uniqueness, timestamp policies), add `validation.script` — a Node.js script body (globals: `fs`, `path`, `memoryRoot`, `memoryId`, `memoryKind`) run over the memory directory after agent execution and before persistence. Throwing, returning `false`, timing out, or exiting nonzero rejects the save. Default timeout 1 minute (`validation.timeout-minutes`, max 5). Same mechanism for `repo-memory`. See [cache-memory reference](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/cache-memory.md#custom-validation) and [repo-memory reference](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/repo-memory.md#custom-validation).

```yaml
tools:
  cache-memory:
    validation:
      timeout-minutes: 1
      script: |
        const index = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(memoryRoot, "index.json"), "utf8"));
        if (!Array.isArray(index.entries)) throw new Error("index.json entries must be an array");
```

### Storage path

- Single cache: `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/`
- Multiple caches: `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/{id}/`

### Branch scoping

Caches are **branch-scoped** with default-branch fallback restore. A feature branch's first restore comes from `main`; subsequent saves fork a branch-local lineage. For warmed-state workflows, schedule on the default branch to reuse one lineage instead of fragmenting state.

### Deduplication example (scheduled workflow)

```markdown
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * *"
permissions:
  issues: read
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues]
  cache-memory: true
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[daily-digest] "
    close-older-issues: true
    labels: [automation]
timeout-minutes: 15
---

Fetch the 20 most recently updated open issues.

Load `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/processed.json` if it exists; it contains issue numbers from past digests. Skip any whose number already appears.

Summarize remaining (new) issues. If none, use the `noop` safe output.

Before finishing, write the updated processed-issue list back to `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/processed.json` using filesystem-safe timestamp `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS` (no colons, no `T`, no `Z`).
```

### Stateful Analysis / Baseline Comparison

Persist a baseline metric (coverage %, build time, benchmark score, audit count) and alert on regression. Cache miss → "no comparison this run" and baseline refreshes silently — tolerable for short-lived quality gates. If a lost baseline causes serious side-effects (e.g. duplicate security issues), use `repo-memory` instead (see [Stateful Scanning Pattern (repo-memory)](#stateful-scanning-pattern-repo-memory)).

> **Worked example** (coverage delta on every PR, with key design decisions): [memory-stateful-patterns.md](memory-stateful-patterns.md#baseline-comparison-cache-memory).

### Tradeoffs

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Zero repository noise — no commits, no PRs | Evicted when cache expires (default 7 days; use `retention-days` to extend up to 90) |
| Fast: no Git operations required | Not human-readable in GitHub UI |
| Works with Copilot, Claude, and custom engines | Data loss if cache is invalidated or expires |
| Supports multiple isolated caches per workflow | Files are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts — **no colons in filenames** |
| Scoped to workflow by default | |

### Filename safety

Cache-memory files upload as Actions artifacts. **Filenames must not contain colons** (NTFS limitation).

```bash
# ✅ GOOD
/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/state-2026-02-12-11-20-45.json

# ❌ BAD — colon breaks artifact upload
/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/state-2026-02-12T11:20:45Z.json
```

When instructing the agent for timestamped files, say: "Use `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS` (no colons, no `T`, no `Z`)."

## `repo-memory` — Long-lived Repository Knowledge

Uses a dedicated Git branch (default: `memory/agent-notes`) to store files that persist indefinitely until explicitly deleted. The directory lives at `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/`.

### When to use

- Knowledge must survive cache expiration
- Memory should be **visible in the repository** (auditable via Git history)
- Knowledge base grows over time (architecture notes, known issues)
- Changes need to appear in diffs and be reviewable

### Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  repo-memory:
    branch-name: memory/agent-notes   # Optional
    target-repo: owner/other-repo     # Optional: store in another repo
    allowed-extensions: [".json", ".md"]
    format-json: true                 # Optional: pretty-print .json (default: false)
    max-file-size: 10240              # bytes
    max-file-count: 100
```

Compiler creates a separate `push_repo_memory` job with `contents: write`; main agent job stays read-only.

### Tradeoffs

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Persists indefinitely (no expiry) | Produces Git commits — repository noise |
| Auditable: Git history shows every change | Slower: requires Git clone + push |
| Survives cache invalidation | Not available for Copilot engine (requires GitHub tools) |
| Human-readable via GitHub branch UI | More complex setup |
| Can target a different repository | |

---

## `repo-memory` with `wiki: true` — GitHub Wiki Backend

`repo-memory` variant that stores files in the **GitHub Wiki** (`<repo>.wiki.git`) instead of a branch.

### When to use

- Structured, human-readable documentation pages
- Knowledge for **human consumption** (browsable wikis)
- Living knowledge base or FAQ

### Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  repo-memory:
    wiki: true
    allowed-extensions: [".md"]
```

The compiler creates a separate `push_repo_memory` job with `contents: write`; the main agent job stays read-only.

Use GitHub Wiki conventions: `[[Page Name]]` for internal links, hyphens instead of spaces in filenames.

### Tradeoffs

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Browsable in the GitHub Wiki UI | Produces Git commits to wiki repo |
| Great for human-readable knowledge bases | Restricted to `.md` files in practice |
| Standard Markdown with wiki link syntax | Less suitable for structured JSON state |
| Separate from main repo history | |

---

## `comment-memory` — Managed Comment Persistence

Uses a `<gh-aw-comment-memory>` XML block in an issue/PR comment as persistent memory. The agent edits markdown files under `/tmp/gh-aw/comment-memory/`; the safe-output processor syncs changes back to the managed comment.

### When to use

- Workflow notes/statuses visible inline on the triggering issue or PR
- State tied to a specific issue or PR lifecycle
- Running track records (status tables, checklists, summaries) readable without leaving the issue

Do NOT use for high-volume ephemeral state (use `cache-memory`), long-lived knowledge bases (use `repo-memory`), or cross-issue data.

### Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  comment-memory: true   # enable with defaults
```

Advanced:

```yaml
tools:
  comment-memory:
    memory-id: status          # Optional: identifier in XML marker (default: "default")
    target: triggering         # Optional: "triggering" (default), "*", or explicit number
    target-repo: owner/other   # Optional: cross-repository
    max: 1                     # Optional: max updates per run (default: 1)
    footer: false              # Optional: omit AI-generated footer (default: true)
```

### How it works

1. **Pre-agent**: reads `<gh-aw-comment-memory id="<memory-id>">` and writes to `/tmp/gh-aw/comment-memory/<memory_id>.md`.
2. **Agent**: edits the markdown file directly — no safe-output tool call needed.
3. **Post-agent**: processor reads edited file and upserts the managed comment, replacing only the XML-fenced block.

Multiple memory IDs in one comment are supported; each maps to a separate `*.md` file.

### Tradeoffs

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Visible in GitHub UI inline on the issue/PR | Requires `issues:write` or `pull-requests:write` |
| No separate branch or cache | One comment block per `memory-id` per target |
| Agent edits plain markdown — no tool call needed | Not suited for large structured data |
| Tied to issue/PR lifecycle | Not available without a triggering issue or PR |

## Stateful Scanning Pattern (repo-memory)

Persist a baseline JSON file between runs to alert only on *new* findings — vulnerability scans, dependency audits, licence checks. Unlike `cache-memory`, the baseline survives cache expiry, so a missed cycle won't flood the repo with duplicate issues. Store only stable identifiers (advisory IDs), cap output with `max:`, treat missing baseline as `[]`. Requires Claude or custom engine — not Copilot.

> **Worked example** (nightly npm vulnerability scan, with key design decisions): [memory-stateful-patterns.md](memory-stateful-patterns.md#stateful-scanning-repo-memory).

## Summary Comparison

| Feature | `cache-memory` | `repo-memory` | `repo-memory` + wiki | `comment-memory` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **First choice** | ✅ Yes | No | No | No |
| **Storage backend** | GitHub Actions cache | Git branch | GitHub Wiki | Issue/PR comment |
| **Persistence** | Up to 90 days | Indefinite | Indefinite | Issue/PR lifetime |
| **Compiler adds `contents: write`** | No | Yes (push job) | Yes (push job) | No |
| **Repository noise** | None | Git commits | Wiki commits | Comment updates |
| **Human-readable in GitHub** | No | Via branch UI | Via Wiki UI | ✅ Inline on issue/PR |
| **Structured data (JSON)** | ✅ Ideal | Possible | Not recommended | Not recommended |
| **Filename restrictions** | No colons in names | None | Hyphens for spaces | None |
| **Engine compatibility** | Copilot, Claude, custom | Claude, custom | Claude, custom | Claude, custom |

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Do not invent `repo-memory` as a synonym for `cache-memory`** — they are different tools
- ❌ **Do not use `repo-memory` for ephemeral per-run state** — use `cache-memory`
- ❌ **Do not use `cache-memory` when you need indefinite persistence** — use `repo-memory`
- ❌ **Do not include colons in cache-memory filenames** — artifact upload will fail
