# GitHub Custom Agent File Format

Use this reference for the GitHub custom agent file format.

## Overview

GitHub Copilot reads custom agent instructions from Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Use them to define specialized behavior, tool access, and workflows for your repository.

## File Locations

Place custom agent files in these locations based on scope:

### 1. Repository-wide Instructions
- **File**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Scope**: Applies to all code generation in the repository
- **Use case**: General coding standards, security requirements, testing practices

### 2. Path-specific Instructions
- **Directory**: `.github/instructions/`
- **Pattern**: `*.instructions.md` (e.g., `frontend.instructions.md`, `backend.instructions.md`)
- **Scope**: Can target specific directories or file patterns using `applyTo` in frontmatter
- **Use case**: Framework-specific guidelines, component-specific rules

### 3. Custom Agent Profiles
- **Directory**: `.github/agents/` or `.github/copilot/instructions/`
- **Pattern**: `AGENTS.md`, `*.md` (e.g., `readme-creator.md`, `test-writer.md`)
- **Scope**: Defines specialized agents with specific capabilities and instructions
- **Use case**: Task-specific agents (documentation, testing, refactoring)

### 4. agentic workflow integration
- **Location**: Imported via `imports` field in workflow frontmatter
- **Pattern**: Any markdown files under `.github/agents/` directory
- **Scope**: Custom agent for specific agentic workflow execution
- **Use case**: Workflow-specific agent configuration
- **Important**: Only one agent file is allowed per workflow

## File Format

### Basic Structure

```markdown
# YAML frontmatter (configuration)
name: agent-name
description: Brief description of agent's purpose

# Markdown body (instructions)

Your natural language instructions for the agent go here.
```

### Complete YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
# Required fields
name: agent-identifier              # Unique identifier for the agent

# Optional descriptive fields
description: >                      # Multi-line description of agent's purpose
  Agent specializing in specific tasks

# Optional instruction fields
prompt: |                          # Freeform instructions (alternative to markdown body)
  Your instructions here

# Optional tool configuration
tools:                             # List of allowed tools for this agent
  - createFile
  - editFiles
  - codeSearch
  - search

# Optional path targeting (for .instructions.md files)
applyTo:                          # Glob patterns for targeted files/directories
  - "src/frontend/**"
  - "**/*.tsx"

# Optional MCP server configuration (enterprise/org only)
mcp-server:                       # External MCP server configuration
  url: https://my-mcp-server.com
  api-key: ${{ secrets.MCPSERVER_API_KEY }}

# Optional settings
settings:                         # Custom runtime or connection settings
  key: value
```

## Field Descriptions

### Core Fields

#### name (string, required for agent profiles)
- Unique identifier for the custom agent
- Used to reference the agent in workflows or assignments
- Convention: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `readme-creator`, `test-writer`)

#### description (string, optional)
- Human-friendly description of the agent's focus and behavior
- Helps users understand what the agent specializes in
- Can be multi-line using YAML's `>` or `|` syntax

#### prompt (string, optional)
- Alternative to using the markdown body for instructions
- Contains freeform natural language instructions
- Use YAML's `|` (literal) or `>` (folded) for multi-line content
- If both `prompt` and markdown body exist, they are typically combined

### Tool Configuration

#### tools (array of strings, optional)
- List of tools the agent is allowed to use
- If omitted or set to `["*"]`, agent has access to all available tools
- Tool names are **case-insensitive**
- Supports both GitHub's standard tool aliases and legacy naming conventions

**GitHub Standard Tool Aliases:**

GitHub Copilot defines a standardized set of tool aliases for custom agents:

- **`read`** - Access and read contents of files or code
- **`edit`** - Make changes in code files, apply edits or refactoring
- **`search`** - Search codebase for keywords, references, or patterns
- **`pr`** - Create, manage, or update pull requests
- **`issue`** - Create, manage, or update issues

**Legacy Tool Names:**

For backward compatibility, these legacy tool names are still supported:

- `createFile` - Create new files (use `edit` instead)
- `editFiles` - Modify existing files (use `edit` instead)
- `deleteFiles` - Remove files (use `edit` instead)
- `codeSearch` - Semantic code search (use `search` instead)
- `runCommand` - Execute shell commands
- `getFile` - Read file contents (use `read` instead)
- `listFiles` - List directory contents (use `read` instead)

**MCP Server Tool Prefixes:**

When using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, you can specify tools with server prefixes:
- Single tool: `my-mcp-server/tool-name`
- All tools from a server: `my-mcp-server/*`

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Using standard tool aliases
tools:
  - read
  - edit
  - search

# Enable all tools with wildcard
tools: ["*"]

# Using legacy names (still supported)
tools:
  - editFiles
  - createFile
  - search

# Mixed standard and MCP server tools
tools:
  - read
  - edit
  - github-mcp/create_issue
  - custom-mcp/*

# Empty list disables all tools
tools: []
```

### Path Targeting

#### applyTo (array of strings, optional)
- Only used in `.instructions.md` files
- Specifies glob patterns for files/directories these instructions apply to
- Supports wildcards: `*` (any characters), `**` (any directories)
- Multiple patterns can be specified

**Example:**
```yaml
applyTo:
  - "src/frontend/**/*.tsx"
  - "src/frontend/**/*.ts"
  - "components/**"
```

### Enterprise Features

#### mcp-server (object, optional)
- Configuration for external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- Typically used in enterprise or organization settings
- Allows integration with custom tools and services

**Fields:**
- `url` (string): MCP server endpoint
- `api-key` (string): Authentication key (use GitHub secrets)

**Example:**
```yaml
mcp-server:
  url: https://internal-tools.company.com/mcp
  api-key: ${{ secrets.INTERNAL_MCP_KEY }}
```

#### settings (object, optional)
- Custom runtime or connection settings
- Key-value pairs for agent-specific configuration
- Format and available keys depend on the agent implementation

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Repository-wide Standards

**File:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

```markdown
description: Repository-wide coding standards

# Coding Standards

## Style Guide
- Use single quotes in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Follow ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.json`
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

## Security
- Always set `httpOnly` and `secure` flags for cookies
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries for database access

## Testing
- All new code must include Jest tests
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
```

### Pattern 2: Path-specific Instructions

**File:** `.github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md`

```markdown
description: Frontend development guidelines
applyTo:
  - "src/frontend/**"
  - "components/**"

# Frontend Development Guidelines

## Component Structure
- Use React functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components small and focused (< 150 lines)

## Styling
- Use CSS Modules for component styles
- Follow BEM naming convention
- Use Tailwind utility classes where appropriate

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Keep local state in components when possible
- Use reducers for complex state logic
```

### Pattern 3: Custom Agent Profile

**File:** `.github/agents/readme-creator.md`

```markdown
name: readme-creator
description: Agent specializing in creating and improving README files
tools:
  - read
  - edit
  - search

# README Creator Agent

You are a documentation specialist focused on creating clear, comprehensive README files.

## Responsibilities
- Create well-structured README.md files for projects
- Include all standard sections: Overview, Installation, Usage, Contributing
- Generate accurate code examples
- Ensure documentation is up-to-date with codebase

## Style Guidelines
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- Add badges for build status, coverage, version
- Organize with logical heading hierarchy
- Include a table of contents for long READMEs

## Quality Standards
- Verify all code examples are accurate
- Test installation instructions
- Ensure links are valid and working
- Check for proper Markdown formatting
```

### Pattern 4: Test Writer Agent

**File:** `.github/agents/test-writer.md`

```markdown
name: test-writer
description: Specialized agent for writing comprehensive test suites
tools:
  - read
  - edit
  - search

# Test Writer Agent

You specialize in creating comprehensive, well-structured test suites.

## Testing Framework
- Use Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Use descriptive test names: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"

## Test Coverage
- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Add edge case tests (null, undefined, empty, boundary values)
- Test error conditions and exception handling

## Test Organization
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` for setup/teardown
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Mock external dependencies

## Best Practices
- One assertion per test when possible
- Use test data builders for complex objects
- Avoid test interdependence
- Keep tests fast (< 1 second each)
```

### Pattern 5: Agentic Workflow Integration

**File:** `.github/workflows/code-review.md`

```markdown
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
engine:
  id: copilot
  custom-agent: .github/agents/code-reviewer.md

# Automated Code Review

Review the pull request changes and provide constructive feedback.
```

**File:** `.github/agents/code-reviewer.md`

```markdown
name: code-reviewer
description: Agent specialized in performing code reviews
tools:
  - read
  - search

# Code Review Agent

You are an experienced code reviewer focused on code quality, security, and best practices.

## Review Checklist
- Code follows repository style guidelines
- Proper error handling is implemented
- Security best practices are followed
- Tests are included for new functionality
- Documentation is updated where needed
- No unnecessary complexity

## Feedback Style
- Be constructive and specific
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Prioritize issues (critical, important, minor)
- Acknowledge good patterns and improvements
- Provide code examples for suggestions
```

## Integration with gh-aw

The gh-aw (GitHub Agentic Workflows) tool supports custom agent files through the `imports` field in workflow frontmatter. Any markdown files under the `.github/agents/` directory are treated as custom agent files when imported.

### Preferred way to install skills in workflows

Use the `skills:` frontmatter field as the preferred way to install external skills for workflow runs. This installs skills during activation and persists them correctly between jobs. Use the top-level `plugins:` field the same way for agent plugins. Never add on-the-fly installation steps or ask the agent to install a skill or plugin from the prompt.

Use `imports:` for workflow prompt/context files (including local custom agent files), not as the primary skill installation path.

```markdown
on: pull_request
engine:
  id: copilot
skills:
  - mattpocock/skills/tdd@801dca688564c529fa84f247f64472520d9ebe28
plugins:
  - octo-org/agent-plugin@v1
imports:
  - .github/agents/code-reviewer.md

# Workflow prompt
```

### Configuration

```markdown
on: issues
engine:
  id: copilot
imports:
  - .github/agents/my-agent.md

# My Workflow

Instructions for the workflow...
```

### Supported Engines

Custom agent files are supported by the following engines:

1. **Copilot** - Uses `--agent <path>` flag to load custom agent file
2. **Claude** - Prepends agent file content to the workflow prompt
3. **Codex** - Prepends agent file content to the workflow prompt

### File Path Resolution

- Agent files are imported via the `imports` field
- Must be markdown files located under `.github/agents/` directory
- Only one agent file is allowed per workflow
- File is validated during workflow compilation
- Checkout step is automatically added if agent file is imported

### Example Workflow with Custom Agent

```markdown
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
engine:
  id: copilot
imports:
  - .github/agents/issue-triager.md
tools:
  github:
    allowed:
      - add_labels_to_issue
      - create_issue_comment

# Issue Triage Workflow

Analyze the issue and categorize it appropriately.
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Instructions Focused
- Each agent should have a clear, specific purpose
- Avoid mixing unrelated concerns in a single agent
- Create multiple specialized agents rather than one general-purpose agent

### 2. Be Explicit and Specific
- Provide concrete examples of expected behavior
- Define clear success criteria
- Specify edge cases and error handling

### 3. Use Appropriate Scoping
- Repository-wide instructions for universal standards
- Path-specific instructions for framework or directory-specific rules
- Custom agents for task-specific workflows

### 4. Test Agent Behavior
- Verify agent follows instructions correctly
- Test with various input scenarios
- Iterate based on actual agent performance

### 5. Maintain and Update
- Keep instructions current with codebase changes
- Review and refine based on agent performance
- Remove outdated or conflicting instructions

### 6. Security Considerations
- Limit tool access to what's necessary
- Be cautious with file deletion permissions
- Use secrets for sensitive configuration
- Review agent actions regularly

## Common Patterns

### Documentation Agent
```yaml
name: documentation-specialist
description: Creates and maintains technical documentation
tools: [read, edit, search]
```

### Refactoring Agent
```yaml
name: code-refactorer
description: Improves code quality and structure
tools: [read, edit, search]
```

### Security Auditor
```yaml
name: security-auditor
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
tools: [read, search]
```

### Migration Assistant
```yaml
name: migration-helper
description: Assists with framework or library migrations
tools: [read, edit, search]
```

### Issue Management Agent
```yaml
name: issue-manager
description: Manages GitHub issues and project tracking
tools: [read, issue]
```

### Pull Request Assistant
```yaml
name: pr-assistant
description: Assists with pull request creation and management
tools: [read, edit, pr]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Following Instructions
- Make instructions more explicit and specific
- Provide concrete examples
- Break down complex instructions into steps
- Ensure instructions don't conflict

### Tool Access Issues
- Verify tools are listed in `tools` array
- Check agent has necessary permissions
- Ensure tools are available in the environment

### Path Targeting Not Working
- Verify glob patterns are correct
- Check file paths match patterns
- Ensure `applyTo` is only used in `.instructions.md` files

### Custom Agent File Not Found
- Verify agent file is imported in the `imports` field
- Ensure file exists and is committed under `.github/agents/` directory
- Confirm agent file path is correct in imports list
- Remember: only one agent file is allowed per workflow
