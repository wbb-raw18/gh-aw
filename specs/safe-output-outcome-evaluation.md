# Safe Output Outcome Evaluation Specification

Every safe output type has a measurable outcome. This spec defines the exact evaluation logic for each type: what to check, how to classify the outcome, and what OTel attributes to emit.

## Principles

1. **Same as a repository observer would check.** If this action happened on GitHub, how would an observer decide it was good from visible repository state?
2. **Direct Outcome Only.** We check whether the action stuck, not whether it caused downstream effects.
3. **Bot-aware, not provenance-perfect.** Distinguish bot/app-visible closes and edits from non-bot ones, but do not assume non-bot actors are unassisted by AI.
4. **Time-bounded.** Check outcomes after a configurable delay (default: 48 hours).

## Norms

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, and **SHOULD** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119). These requirements apply to **outcome evaluation workers** as the primary conformance target unless a different conformance target is explicitly named in the requirement.

1. Outcome evaluation workers **MUST** treat GitHub API `404` responses as terminal for deleted or inaccessible objects and classify according to object semantics (for example, a deleted issue/PR should be `rejected`, while a transient target with no persistent evaluable object should be `ignored`).
2. Outcome evaluation workers **MUST** treat GitHub API `5xx` responses as transient infrastructure failures and return `pending` for that check cycle while recording retry metadata (`status_code`, `retry_after`, `attempt`).
3. Outcome evaluation workers **MUST** treat GitHub API rate-limit responses (`403` with limit exhaustion or `429`) as transient. Outcome evaluation workers **SHOULD** reschedule evaluation using the reset window before emitting final outcomes.
4. Outcome evaluation workers **MUST NOT** emit `accepted` or `rejected` when API failures prevent verification of the authoritative object state.

## Provenance Limits

Outcome evaluation is based on observable GitHub state and actor identity, not hidden authoring provenance.

1. Outcome evaluation workers **MUST** treat actions performed by visible bot or app identities as bot/app actions.
2. Outcome evaluation workers **MUST** treat actions performed by visible non-bot user identities as non-bot actions, even if those users may have used Copilot or another AI assistant.
3. Outcome evaluation workers **MUST NOT** infer hidden AI assistance when GitHub exposes only a normal user identity.
4. Metrics and fields that use `human_*` names are historical names. In this specification they mean actor-visible, non-bot activity unless explicit provenance metadata is available.
5. Implementations **SHOULD** prefer explicit provenance markers when available, such as bot identities, GitHub App identities, trace IDs, labels, commit trailers, or other durable metadata emitted by the workflow.
6. When GitHub surfaces an action under a GitHub App or bot identity (including app-token API writes performed on behalf of a human), outcome evaluation workers **MUST** classify that action as bot/app activity for `human_*` fields unless separate durable provenance metadata explicitly identifies a visible non-bot actor.

## Outcome Categories

Every evaluation produces one of these outcomes:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `accepted` | The action was kept, merged, resolved, or engaged with |
| `rejected` | The action was undone, closed-as-not-planned, removed, or reverted |
| `ignored` | No observable non-bot interaction within the evaluation window |
| `pending` | The object has not reached a terminal state yet |
| `lifecycle` | Closed/removed by the workflow itself (e.g., `close-older-issues`) — not a rejection |
| `lifecycle_close` | Closed by lifecycle/noop bot policy and not reopened by a visible non-bot actor |

## Common OTel Attributes

Every outcome span carries these attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `gh-aw.outcome.type` | string | Safe output type (e.g., `create_pull_request`) |
| `gh-aw.outcome.result` | string | One of: `accepted`, `rejected`, `ignored`, `pending`, `lifecycle`, `lifecycle_close` |
| `gh-aw.outcome.object_url` | string | GitHub URL of the affected object |
| `gh-aw.outcome.object_number` | int | Issue/PR/discussion number |
| `gh-aw.outcome.repo` | string | `owner/repo` |
| `gh-aw.outcome.source_run_id` | string | Workflow run that created this output |
| `gh-aw.outcome.source_trace_id` | string | Original OTLP trace ID |
| `gh-aw.outcome.created_at` | string | When the safe output was executed |
| `gh-aw.outcome.checked_at` | string | When this evaluation ran |
| `gh-aw.outcome.time_to_outcome_hours` | float | Hours from creation to terminal state |
| `gh-aw.outcome.human_comments` | int | Historical field name; means actor-visible non-bot comments on the object |
| `gh-aw.outcome.human_edits` | int | Historical field name; means actor-visible non-bot edits before acceptance |
| `gh-aw.outcome.zero_touch` | bool | Accepted with no actor-visible non-bot modifications |

## Implementation

The following implementation areas are responsible for evaluation data capture, outcome classification plumbing, and runtime event artifacts.

Status meanings:
- `implemented`: dedicated evaluator logic exists in both Go and JS.
- `partial`: dedicated evaluator exists in one runtime; the other relies on generic fallback logic.
- `not-started`: no dedicated evaluator exists yet; current behavior is generic/no-op only.

### Current Default Acceptance Map

This table summarizes the current runtime behavior in `pkg/cli/outcome_eval*.go`. It is intentionally about what the evaluator accepts today, not just the intended long-term spec semantics.

Rows marked `evalGenericSticky` fallback are generic existence checks, not type-specific acceptance logic.

---

## 1. `create_pull_request`

**Question:** Was the PR merged?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| `merged == true` | `accepted` |
| `state == "closed"` and `merged == false` | `rejected` |
| `state == "open"` | `pending` |

**Extra signals:**
- `human_edits`: historical field name; count actor-visible non-bot commits pushed by users other than the PR author after creation
- `human_comments`: historical field name; count actor-visible non-bot comments on the PR
- `zero_touch`: `accepted` and `human_edits == 0`, meaning no actor-visible non-bot follow-up
- `time_to_outcome_hours`: `merged_at - created_at` or `closed_at - created_at`

**Additional OTel attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ghaw.outcome.pr.merged` | bool | Whether PR was merged |
| `ghaw.outcome.pr.review_count` | int | Number of reviews submitted |
| `ghaw.outcome.pr.additions` | int | Lines added |
| `ghaw.outcome.pr.deletions` | int | Lines deleted |

---

## 2. `create_issue`

**Question:** Was the issue resolved or dismissed?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| `state == "closed"` and `state_reason == "completed"` | `accepted` |
| `state == "closed"` and `state_reason == "not_planned"` and closed by bot | `lifecycle` |
| `state == "closed"` and `state_reason == "not_planned"` and closed by a visible non-bot actor | `rejected` |
| `state == "open"` and has non-bot comments | `pending` (engaged) |
| `state == "open"` and no non-bot comments | `ignored` |

**Bot detection:** check the close event in `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/timeline` — if the actor is `github-actions[bot]`, classify as `lifecycle` not `rejected`.

**Extra signals:**
- `human_comments`: historical field name; non-bot comments
- Reactions on the issue body

**Additional OTel attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ghaw.outcome.issue.state_reason` | string | `completed` or `not_planned` |
| `ghaw.outcome.issue.closed_by` | string | Username that closed the issue |
| `ghaw.outcome.issue.closed_by_bot` | bool | Whether a bot closed it |

---

## 3. `add_comment`

**Question:** Did anyone respond or react?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Comment has replies (subsequent comments referencing it) or reactions > 0 | `accepted` |
| Comment exists, no replies, no reactions | `ignored` |
| Comment was deleted (404) | `rejected` |
| Comment was minimized | `rejected` |

**Extra signals:**
- Reaction count and types
- Reply count (comments posted after this one on the same issue/PR)

**Additional OTel attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ghaw.outcome.comment.reactions` | int | Total reaction count |
| `ghaw.outcome.comment.replies` | int | Subsequent comments on same thread |
| `ghaw.outcome.comment.minimized` | bool | Whether the comment was hidden |

---

## 4. `add_labels`

**Question:** Did the labels stick?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/labels`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| All added labels still present | `accepted` |
| Some labels removed | `rejected` (partial) |
| All labels removed | `rejected` |

**Additional OTel attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ghaw.outcome.labels.added` | int | Labels the workflow added |
| `ghaw.outcome.labels.retained` | int | Labels still present |
| `ghaw.outcome.labels.removed` | int | Labels that were removed |

**API failure safeguards (`add_labels`):**

1. If `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/labels` returns `404`, the evaluator **MUST** classify as `rejected` because the authoritative labeling target is no longer reachable.
2. If the API returns `5xx`, timeout, or transport failure, the evaluator **MUST** classify as `pending`, record retry metadata, and retry without emitting a terminal outcome.
3. If the API returns rate-limit responses (`403` exhaustion or `429`), the evaluator **MUST** classify as `pending` and reschedule evaluation using the reset window.
4. While any transient API failure condition exists, evaluators **MUST NOT** emit `accepted` or `rejected` for label stickiness.

---

## 5. `add_reviewer`

**Question:** Did the reviewer actually review?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| At least one review submitted by the assigned reviewer | `accepted` |
| No review from assigned reviewer but PR still open | `pending` |
| No review and PR closed/merged | `ignored` |

**Additional OTel attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ghaw.outcome.reviewer.reviewed` | bool | Whether the assigned reviewer submitted a review |
| `ghaw.outcome.reviewer.review_state` | string | `approved`, `changes_requested`, `commented` |

---

## 6. `update_issue`

**Question:** Did the edit stick?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Changed fields still match the persisted `after_state` snapshot | `accepted` |
| Changed fields match the persisted `before_state` snapshot again | `rejected` |
| Changed fields differ from both `before_state` and `after_state` | `rejected` |
| Required `before_state` / `after_state` snapshots are missing | `unknown` |

**Detection:** compare the current issue fields against the execution-time `before_state` and `after_state` snapshots captured in the safe-output manifest. Compare `title`, normalized `body_hash`, `state`, `labels`, and `assignees`.

---

## 7. `update_pull_request`

**Question:** Did the edit stick?

Same retained-update logic as `update_issue` but on a PR object, using persisted execution-time snapshots instead of `updated_at`.

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}`

**Detection:** compare the current PR fields against the execution-time `before_state` and `after_state` snapshots. Compare `title`, normalized `body_hash`, `state`, `base`, `draft`, and `head_sha`. If the retained state later merges, classify that acceptance as stronger evidence.

---

## 8. `close_issue`

**Question:** Did it stay closed?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`

**Evaluation order:** first check the current issue state. If the issue is currently open (meaning it was reopened after a prior close), classify as `rejected` regardless of prior close actor. Only currently closed issues use actor-based classification below.

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Issue still closed and close actor is `github-actions[bot]` or configured lifecycle bot | `lifecycle_close` |
| Issue still closed and close actor is a non-lifecycle actor (visible non-bot user or non-lifecycle GitHub App/integration) | `rejected` |
| Issue reopened | `rejected` |

---

## 9. `close_pull_request`

**Question:** Did it stay closed?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}`

**Evaluation order:** first check the current PR state. If the PR is currently open (meaning it was reopened after a prior close), classify as `rejected` regardless of prior close actor. Only currently closed PRs use actor-based classification below.

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| PR still closed and close actor is `github-actions[bot]` or configured lifecycle bot | `lifecycle_close` |
| PR still closed and close actor is a non-lifecycle actor (visible non-bot user or non-lifecycle GitHub App/integration) | `rejected` |
| PR reopened | `rejected` |

---

| Linked PR merged | `accepted` |
| Linked PR closed | `rejected` |
| Alert still open | `pending` |

---

## 22. `create_code_scanning_alert`

| Alert state `dismissed` with reason | `accepted` (triaged) |
| Alert still `open` | `pending` |

---

## 23. `link_sub_issue`

**API:** GraphQL `issue.subIssues`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Sub-issue link still present | `accepted` |

---

## 24. `hide_comment`

**Question:** Did it stay hidden?

**API:** GraphQL `node(id:)` → `isMinimized`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Comment still minimized | `accepted` |
| Comment un-minimized | `rejected` |

---

## 25. `assign_milestone`

**Question:** Did the milestone stick?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Milestone still assigned | `accepted` |
| Milestone removed or changed | `rejected` |

---

## 26. `update_project`

**Question:** Did the field value stick?

**API:** GraphQL `projectV2` → field value query

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/{release_id}`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Release body/name unchanged since workflow edit | `accepted` |

---

## 28. `noop`

No outcome to evaluate. Skip.

## 29. `missing_tool`

No outcome to evaluate. Skip.

## 30. `replace_label`

**Question:** Did the label replacement stick? Specifically: is `label_to_add` present on the item and is `label_to_remove` absent?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/labels`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| `label_to_add` is present on the item AND `label_to_remove` is absent | `accepted` |
| `label_to_add` is absent from the item | `rejected` |
| `label_to_add` is present but `label_to_remove` is also still present | `rejected` (partial failure — remove did not apply) |
| Item not found (`404`) | Outcome evaluation workers **MUST** classify as `rejected` |
| API transient failure (`5xx`, timeout, transport error) | Outcome evaluation workers **MUST** classify as `pending` |
| Rate-limit response (`403` exhaustion or `429`) | Outcome evaluation workers **MUST** classify as `pending` and **SHOULD** reschedule using the reset window |
| `lifecycle` | N/A — `replace_label` has no lifecycle bot-close behavior |
| `lifecycle_close` | N/A — `replace_label` has no lifecycle bot-close behavior |
| `ignored` | N/A — label state is always evaluable when the item is accessible; no time-bounded engagement signal applies |

**Extra signals:**
- `label_to_add`: the label name that should be present after the replacement
- `label_to_remove`: the label name that should be absent after the replacement
- `zero_touch`: `accepted` and no actor-visible non-bot label changes detected after the replacement

**Additional OTel attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ghaw.outcome.replace_label.label_to_add` | string | Label that should be present after the replacement |
| `ghaw.outcome.replace_label.label_to_remove` | string | Label that should be absent after the replacement |
| `ghaw.outcome.replace_label.add_present` | bool | Whether `label_to_add` is present at evaluation time |
| `ghaw.outcome.replace_label.remove_absent` | bool | Whether `label_to_remove` is absent at evaluation time |

**API failure safeguards (`replace_label`):**

1. If `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/labels` returns `404`, outcome evaluation workers **MUST** classify as `rejected` because the authoritative labeling target is no longer reachable.
2. If the API returns `5xx`, timeout, or transport failure, outcome evaluation workers **MUST** classify as `pending`, record retry metadata, and retry without emitting a terminal outcome.
3. If the API returns rate-limit responses (`403` exhaustion or `429`), outcome evaluation workers **MUST** classify as `pending` and reschedule evaluation using the reset window.
4. While any transient API failure condition exists, outcome evaluation workers **MUST NOT** emit `accepted` or `rejected` for label replacement state.

**Sync note:** Keep the API failure safeguards above aligned with [`replace-label-spec.md` Section 7](replace-label-spec.md#7-error-handling), which defines the shared `404`, `5xx`, and `429` REST failure semantics for `replace_label`.

**References:** See [replace-label-spec.md](replace-label-spec.md) for the full definition of the `replace_label` safe-output type, including the message schema, processing model, and REST interface.

| Metric | Formula | Description | Go aggregation owner | OTel emission owner |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `acceptance_rate` | accepted / (accepted + rejected) | How often actions are kept | `pkg/cli/outcome_eval.go` (`ComputeOutcomeSummary`) | `actions/setup/js/emit_outcome_spans.cjs` (`buildSummaryAttributes`) |
| `waste_rate` | rejected / total | How often actions are undone | `pkg/cli/outcome_eval.go` (`ComputeOutcomeSummary`) | `actions/setup/js/emit_outcome_spans.cjs` (`buildSummaryAttributes`) |
| `ignore_rate` | ignored / total | How often actions get no response | `pkg/cli/outcome_eval.go` (`ComputeOutcomeSummary`) | `actions/setup/js/emit_outcome_spans.cjs` (`buildSummaryAttributes`) |
| `zero_touch_rate` | zero_touch / accepted | How often accepted actions need no actor-visible non-bot edits | `pkg/cli/outcome_eval.go` (`ComputeOutcomeSummary`) | `actions/setup/js/emit_outcome_spans.cjs` (`buildSummaryAttributes`) |
| `time_to_outcome` | median(time_to_outcome_hours) | How fast outcomes resolve | `pkg/cli/outcome_eval.go` (`ComputeOutcomeSummary`) | `actions/setup/js/emit_outcome_spans.cjs` (`buildSummaryAttributes`) |

## Implementation Priority

Start with the 5 highest-value, lowest-effort types:

1. `create_pull_request` — cleanest signal, most valuable
2. `create_issue` — common, needs bot-aware close detection
3. `add_comment` — very common, engagement signal
4. `add_labels` — simple binary check
5. `assign_to_agent` — important for delegation workflows

These cover the majority of safe output usage. Add the rest incrementally.

## Conformance

### Conformance Test Table

The table below specifies one conformance test row per safe-output type. Each row defines the expected OTel attribute value emitted by a correct evaluator, the pass condition (what must be true for `accepted`), and the fail condition (what signals `rejected`). Implementations **MUST** satisfy the pass condition and **MUST** not emit `accepted` when the fail condition is observed.

### Structure: Safe-Output Section-to-Implementation Mapping

Each numbered safe-output-type section above corresponds to a dedicated configuration/compilation implementation file under `pkg/workflow/`. This mapping is distinct from the Compliance test mapping above; it maps specification sections to the Go source that defines and compiles the output type (shared cross-cutting logic such as `safe_output_handlers.go` and `compiler_safe_outputs_job.go` is omitted for brevity since it applies to all types).

| Section | Output type | Implementation file(s) |
|---|---|---|
| §1 | `create_pull_request` | `pkg/workflow/create_pull_request.go` |
| §2 | `create_issue` | `pkg/workflow/create_issue.go` |

| §29 | `missing_tool` | `pkg/workflow/missing_issue_reporting.go` |
| §30 | `replace_label` | `pkg/workflow/replace_label.go` |

Sync procedure: when a safe-output type's implementation file is renamed, split, or removed, update the corresponding row in this table in the same change that moves the code.

### OTel Backend Unavailability

When the OTLP exporter is unavailable (e.g., endpoint unreachable, network timeout, authentication failure) during outcome evaluation, the following safeguards **MUST** apply:

1. **Graceful degradation**: Outcome evaluation workers **MUST** complete their classification logic (determining `accepted`, `rejected`, `ignored`, etc.) regardless of OTLP exporter availability. The computed outcome **MUST** be persisted to a local audit fallback log (e.g., a NDJSON file at a known path such as `/tmp/gh-aw/outcome-audit.ndjson`) before any attempt to export to OTLP. If the OTLP export fails, the local audit log entry **MUST** still be written and **MUST NOT** be discarded. This ensures the outcome is recoverable even when the telemetry backend is down.

2. **Audit fallback and retry**: When OTLP export fails, the evaluation worker **SHOULD** schedule a retry using an exponential back-off strategy (initial delay: 5 seconds; maximum delay: 5 minutes; maximum attempts: 5). If all retries are exhausted without a successful export, the worker **MUST** record the export failure in the local audit log with a `export_failed: true` flag and the final error reason. A downstream reconciliation process **SHOULD** periodically sweep the local audit log and re-attempt export for any entries marked `export_failed: true`.

### Conformance Safeguard Coverage Requirements

Conformance suites **MUST** include explicit safeguard coverage classes in addition to happy-path outcome checks:

1. **Class A (state success/failure):** validates standard accepted/rejected/ignored/pending transitions from authoritative object state.
2. **Class B (human override/lifecycle):** validates human edits, deletions, reopen events, and lifecycle outcomes where applicable.
3. **Class C (API degradation):** validates `404`, `5xx`, timeout, and rate-limit behaviors, including retry metadata and non-terminal handling.

Every safe-output type **MUST** have at least one Class A test. Types that query GitHub APIs for evaluation **MUST** also include at least one Class C test case.

## Formal Model

The outcome evaluation engine is encoded as a state machine with invariants using TLA+, F* pre/post contracts, and Z3/SMT-LIB arithmetic bounds.

**State space** (`OutcomeState`):

```
OutcomeState ≜ [
  type       : SafeOutputType,
  result     : OutcomeResult,
  evalError  : String ∪ {nil},
  detail     : String,
  apiStatus  : Int ∪ {nil},
  actor      : ActorIdentity,
  checkTime  : Timestamp
]
```

**TLA+ invariants** (one per state-machine guarantee):

```tla
OutcomeDomain ≜
  ∀ s ∈ OutcomeState :
    s.result ∈ {"accepted","rejected","ignored","pending","lifecycle","lifecycle_close"}
    ∨ s.result ∈ {"unknown","error"}

APIFailureNeverTerminal ≜
  ∀ s ∈ OutcomeState :
    (s.apiStatus ∈ {500,502,503,429} ∨ s.apiStatus = 403 ∧ RateLimited(s)) ⟹
      s.result ≠ "accepted" ∧ s.result ≠ "rejected"

NotFoundClassification ≜
  ∀ s ∈ OutcomeState :
    s.apiStatus = 404 ∧ persistent(s.type) ⟹ s.result = "rejected" ∧
    s.apiStatus = 404 ∧ transient(s.type) ⟹ s.result = "ignored"

BotActorProvenance ≜
  ∀ actor : ActorIdentity :
    isBotActor(actor) ↔ HasSuffix(actor.login, "[bot]") ∨ actor.login ∈ KnownBotLogins

PRMergeAcceptance ≜
  ∀ pr : PullRequest :
    pr.merged = true                   ⟹ outcome = "accepted" ∧
    pr.state = "closed" ∧ ¬pr.merged  ⟹ outcome = "rejected" ∧
    pr.state = "open"                  ⟹ outcome = "pending"

IssueBotCloseLifecycle ≜
  ∀ issue : Issue :
    issue.state = "closed" ∧ issue.stateReason = "not_planned" ∧ closedByBot  ⟹ result = "lifecycle" ∧
    issue.state = "closed" ∧ issue.stateReason = "not_planned" ∧ ¬closedByBot ⟹ result = "rejected" ∧
    issue.state = "closed" ∧ issue.stateReason = "completed"                   ⟹ result = "accepted"

CloseStickyReopenRejection ≜
  ∀ item : close_issue ∪ close_pull_request :
    current.state = "closed" ⟹ result = "accepted" ∧
    current.state = "open"   ⟹ result = "rejected"

APIErrorNotTerminal ≜
  ∀ pr : PullRequest, err : APIError :
    fetch(pr) = err ⟹ outcome = "error"

ZeroTouchRequiresNoReviews ≜
  ∀ pr : PullRequest :
    pr.zeroTouch ⟹ pr.outcome = "accepted" ∧
      pr.humanComments = 0 ∧ pr.humanReviews = 0
```

**F* pre/post contracts** (selected):

```fstar
val evaluateWithAPIError :
  item:CreatedItemReport → err:APIError →
  Tot OutcomeReport
  (requires err.status ∈ {500, 502, 503, 429} ∨ RateLimited err)
  (ensures fun r → r.Result ≠ OutcomeAccepted ∧ r.Result ≠ OutcomeRejected)

val labelRetentionMonotonicity :
  before:list string → after:list string → current:list string →
  Tot retainedStateComparison
  (requires Subset before after)
  (ensures fun c →
    Subset after current ⟹ c.Retained ≠ [] ∧
    ¬Subset after current ⟹ c.Reverted ≠ [] ∨ c.Replaced ≠ [])

val compareUpdateSnapshot :
  before:state → after:state → current:state → fields:list string →
  Tot retainedStateComparison
  (ensures fun c →
    current = after  ⟹ c.Retained = c.Changed ∧
    current = before ⟹ c.Reverted = c.Changed ∧
    current ≠ before ∧ current ≠ after ⟹ c.Replaced = c.Changed)

val evaluateOutcome :
  item:CreatedItemReport → transportOK:bool →
  Tot OutcomeReport
  (requires True)
  (ensures fun r →
    r.Type ≠ "" ∧ r.Result ∈ KnownOutcomeResults ∧
    normalizeOutcomeEvaluation(r).OutcomeStatus ≠ "" ∧
    normalizeOutcomeEvaluation(r).EvidenceStrength ≠ "")
```

**Z3/SMT-LIB bounds** (derived metrics zero-safety):

```smt2
(declare-const accepted Int)
(declare-const rejected Int)
(declare-const total    Int)
(assert (>= accepted 0))
(assert (>= rejected 0))
(assert (>= total (+ accepted rejected)))
(assert (=> (> (+ accepted rejected) 0)
            (= acceptance_rate (/ accepted (+ accepted rejected)))))
(assert (=> (> total 0)
            (= waste_rate (/ rejected total))))
(assert (=> (= (+ accepted rejected) 0) (= acceptance_rate 0.0)))
(assert (=> (= total 0) (= waste_rate 0.0)))
(check-sat) ; sat — formulas are consistent and division-by-zero safe
```

| `P10` Derived-Metrics-Consistency | `TestFormalDerivedMetricsConsistency` | acceptance_rate and waste_rate formulas; division-by-zero safety |
| `P11` OTel-Graceful-Degradation | `TestFormalOTelGracefulDegradation` | OTLP failure still writes audit log; outcome not discarded |
| `P12` Conformance-Class-Coverage | `TestFormalConformanceClassCoverage` | Class A/C test existence invariant structure |
| `P14` API-Error-Not-Terminal | `TestFormalAPIErrorNotTerminal` | An authoritative PR fetch error produces `error`, never a terminal outcome |
| `P15` Zero-Touch-Requires-No-Reviews | `TestFormalZeroTouchRequiresNoReviews` | `zero_touch` requires zero non-bot comments and zero reviews |

`P13` covers the worker's configurable evaluation delay and is intentionally outside this in-process evaluator suite.

## Generated Test Suite

The 14 test functions above are implemented in
`pkg/cli/outcome_eval_formal_test.go` using the Go `testify` library.
All tests carry the `//go:build !integration` tag so they run in the default
unit-test suite without any special flags.

Each test function:

- maps to exactly one predicate/invariant in the coverage map above;
- calls production code directly (no stubs beyond the established `*GHAPIGet` variable pattern);
- uses `assert`/`require` calls whose failure messages quote the predicate identifier and the violated invariant clause;
- is independently runnable with `go test -run <TestFunctionName>`.

Run the full formal suite:

```sh
go test ./pkg/cli/ -run 'TestFormalOutcomeDomainInvariant|TestFormalAPIFailurePending|TestFormal404Classification|TestFormalBotActorProvenance|TestFormalPRMergeAcceptance|TestFormalIssueBotCloseLifecycle|TestFormalLabelStickiness|TestFormalUpdateSnapshotComparison|TestFormalCloseStickyReopenRejection|TestFormalDerivedMetricsConsistency|TestFormalOTelGracefulDegradation|TestFormalConformanceClassCoverage|TestFormalAPIErrorNotTerminal|TestFormalZeroTouchRequiresNoReviews' -v
```

### Formal Notation Cross-References

| Notation | Predicates | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| TLA+ state-machine invariants | P1, P4, P5, P6, P9 | State transition correctness |
| F* pre/post contracts | P2, P3, P7, P8, P11, P12 | Function-level contracts |
| Z3/SMT-LIB arithmetic bounds | P10 | Division-by-zero safety for derived metrics |

## Change Log

### Version 1.0.1 (Working Draft, 2026-08-01)

- Clarified provenance-resolution rules for `human_*` metrics when GitHub Apps act on behalf of humans.
- Added a section-to-test cross-reference table for all 30 safe-output types, marking uncovered rows as `not-started`.
- See also: `specs/otel-observability-spec.md` §13 (Outcome Evaluation) and §19 (Change Log).
