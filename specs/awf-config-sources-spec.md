## 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical AWF configuration references in `github/gh-aw-firewall` that gh-aw agents and schema reconciliation workflows MUST use when generating or validating AWF config behavior.

## 2. Canonical sources (gh-aw-firewall)

The following documents are authoritative and MUST be consulted together:

### 2.1 Normative specification

- `docs/awf-config-spec.md` — processing model, precedence, CLI mapping, env merge semantics, credential isolation

### 2.2 JSON schemas

- `docs/awf-config.schema.json` — published schema for `.awf.json` / `.awf.yml`
- `src/awf-config-schema.json` — runtime schema source used by AWF CLI
- `schemas/audit.schema.json` — schema for firewall audit output
- `schemas/token-usage.schema.json` — schema for token usage output

### 2.3 Supporting docs

- `docs/environment.md` — environment variable configuration behavior
- `docs/authentication-architecture.md` — credential isolation architecture
- `schemas/README.md` — schema directory overview

## Structure

This specification, the [conformance fixture index](awf-config-sources-compliance/README.md), and
[`pkg/workflow/awf_config_drift_test.go`](../pkg/workflow/awf_config_drift_test.go) form one
conformance unit. The specification defines `DriftRecord` requirements, the fixture index maps
them to `T-DR-*` IDs, and the Go test file implements those IDs. Changes to any member of this
unit **MUST** keep the other two members synchronized.

## 3. Data Model

This section defines the canonical data entities used in the drift detection procedure. The
repository relationships that maintain its conformance coverage are defined in
[Structure](#structure). The `DriftRecord` entity is the primary structured output of drift
detection.

### 3.1 DriftRecord

A `DriftRecord` represents a single detected schema drift item. All automation and agents that produce or consume drift reports **MUST** use this schema for structured drift output. See Section 7.5 for how `DriftRecord` objects are produced and consumed within the drift detection procedure.

#### 3.1.1 Formal Schema (JSON Schema)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "DriftRecord",
  "description": "A single detected configuration drift item between gh-aw-firewall canonical sources and gh-aw implementation.",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["property_path", "drift_category", "suggested_action", "detected_at"],
  "properties": {
    "property_path": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Dot-notation path to the drifted configuration property (e.g., 'apiProxy.anthropicAutoCache').",
      "examples": ["apiProxy.anthropicAutoCache", "container.dockerHostPathPrefix"]
    },
    "drift_category": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["missing_in_ghaw", "missing_in_schema", "spec_mismatch"],
      "description": "Classification of the drift condition. 'missing_in_ghaw': property exists in canonical schema but gh-aw has no coverage. 'missing_in_schema': gh-aw generates a field not present in either schema. 'spec_mismatch': CLI mapping in gh-aw disagrees with the normative spec description."
    },
    "suggested_action": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Human-readable remediation recommendation for this drift item (e.g., 'Add coverage for apiProxy.anthropicAutoCache in pkg/workflow/ and reconcile with docs/awf-config-spec.md CLI mapping table').",
      "minLength": 1
    },
    "detected_at": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time",
      "description": "ISO 8601 timestamp (UTC) when this drift item was first detected in the current run."
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

#### 3.1.2 Field Reference and Implementation Sync Notes

| Property | Type | Required | Description | Implementation file |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `property_path` | `string` | **MUST** | Dot-notation config property path (e.g., `apiProxy.anthropicAutoCache`) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_drift_formal_test.go` (`FormalDriftRecord.PropertyPath`); production emission target: `pkg/workflow/` drift detection logic |
| `drift_category` | `enum` | **MUST** | One of `missing_in_ghaw`, `missing_in_schema`, or `spec_mismatch` (see Section 7.2, Step 4) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_drift_formal_test.go` (`FormalDriftRecord.DriftCategory`, `formalDriftCategoryExhaustiveness`); production emission target: `pkg/workflow/` drift detection logic |
| `suggested_action` | `string` | **MUST** | Actionable remediation text; **MUST NOT** be empty | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_drift_formal_test.go` (`FormalDriftRecord.SuggestedAction`, `formalDriftRecordStructuralValidity`); production emission target: `pkg/workflow/` drift detection logic |
| `detected_at` | `string` (ISO 8601) | **MUST** | UTC timestamp of detection; filesystem-safe format **SHOULD** use `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_drift_formal_test.go` (`FormalDriftRecord.DetectedAt`); production emission target: `pkg/workflow/` drift detection logic |

Decision: `suggested_action` remains free-form remediation text rather than an enum. Drift remediation can require different downstream actions depending on the affected property, source repository, and owning implementation path, so constraining the field to a fixed enum would either lose actionable detail or require frequent schema churn. Conformance therefore requires the field to be present and non-empty (T-DR-004), while producers SHOULD write a concrete action such as adding coverage, opening a corrective PR, updating a spec, or recording a waiver rationale.

The conformance fixture index assigns the following test IDs to the `DriftRecord` schema requirements:

- Required fields: T-DR-001
- `drift_category` enum: T-DR-002
- `detected_at` format: T-DR-003
- `suggested_action` non-empty: T-DR-004
- No additional properties: T-DR-005

## 4. Required coverage checks

When updating AWF config generation, schema sync, or validation in gh-aw, agents MUST verify:

1. Every relevant property in `docs/awf-config.schema.json` is represented in gh-aw logic.
2. CLI mapping behavior in `docs/awf-config-spec.md` is reconciled with schema-defined properties.
3. Config-only fields (without CLI flags) are still modeled where required by runtime behavior.

## 5. Known drift example (apiProxy)

The following fields previously existed in schema but were missed in spec CLI mapping checks:

| Config path | CLI flag | Test reference |
|---|---|---|
| `apiProxy.anthropicAutoCache` | `--anthropic-auto-cache` | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `apiProxy.anthropicCacheTailTtl` | `--anthropic-cache-tail-ttl` | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `apiProxy.models` | config-only (model alias rewriting) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `apiProxy.modelMultipliers` | config-only (AI Credits accounting) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `apiProxy.modelFallback` | config-only (model fallback policy; set `sandbox.agent.model-fallback: false` to prevent deployment-name rewriting for BYOK Azure) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` (`TestAWFConfig_ModelFallback*`) |
| `apiProxy.enableTokenSteering` | config-only (set `sandbox.agent.token-steering: false` to preserve the explicitly configured provider and model) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `apiProxy.maxRuns` | config-only (LLM invocation hard cap) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `apiProxy.auth.*` | config-only (maps to `AWF_AUTH_*` env vars) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `apiProxy.targets.openai.authHeader` | `--openai-api-auth-header` (frontmatter: `sandbox.agent.targets.openai.authHeader`) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `apiProxy.targets.anthropic.authHeader` | `--anthropic-api-auth-header` (frontmatter: `sandbox.agent.targets.anthropic.authHeader`) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `apiProxy.targets.copilot.extraHeaders` | config-only (frontmatter: `sandbox.agent.targets.copilot.extraHeaders`; maps to `AWF_BYOK_EXTRA_HEADERS`) | `pkg/workflow/copilot_byok_extra_fields_compilation_test.go` (`TestCopilotBYOKExtraFieldsInCompiledWorkflow`) |
| `apiProxy.targets.copilot.extraBodyFields` | config-only (frontmatter: `sandbox.agent.targets.copilot.extraBodyFields`; maps to `AWF_BYOK_EXTRA_BODY_FIELDS`) | `pkg/workflow/copilot_byok_extra_fields_compilation_test.go` (`TestCopilotBYOKExtraFieldsInCompiledWorkflow`) |
| `apiProxy.targets.copilot.sessionId` | config-only (frontmatter: `sandbox.agent.targets.copilot.sessionId`; maps to `AWF_PROVIDER_SESSION_ID`) | `pkg/workflow/copilot_byok_extra_fields_compilation_test.go` (`TestCopilotBYOKExtraFieldsInCompiledWorkflow`) |
| `apiProxy.caCert` | config-only (frontmatter: `sandbox.agent.ca-cert`; gated to AWF v0.28.10+ via `AWFAPIProxyCACertMinVersion`) | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `container.dockerHostPathPrefix` | `--docker-host-path-prefix` | `pkg/workflow/awf_config_test.go` |
| `enclaves[].agent.tools.github` | config-only (frontmatter: `enclaves[].agent.tools.github`; gated to AWF v0.28.20+ via `AWFEnclaveAgentToolsMinVersion`) | `pkg/workflow/enclaves_test.go` |

Agents SHOULD treat this class of mismatch as a regression signal and open a corrective PR when detected.

## 6. Conformance Requirements

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** in this section are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

### Norms

This subsection identifies the normative behavior that conforming AWF config source checks must satisfy. The `CR-*` requirements below bind the canonical-source lookup rules, drift classification semantics, and remediation expectations to the `DriftRecord` entity in [Section 3.1](#31-driftrecord) and the drift detection procedure in [Section 7](#7-drift-detection-procedure).

**CR-01**: Agents and schema reconciliation workflows MUST consult **both** the normative specification (`docs/awf-config-spec.md`) and the published JSON schema (`docs/awf-config.schema.json`) before generating or validating AWF config behavior. Consulting only one source is insufficient.

**CR-02**: When a property exists in the JSON schema but has no corresponding entry in the normative spec CLI mapping table, agents MUST treat this as a drift condition and flag it for corrective action.

**CR-03**: Agents MUST NOT generate AWF config fields that are absent from both the normative spec and all JSON schemas. Undocumented fields are out of scope and may be silently ignored or rejected by the AWF CLI.

**CR-04**: Schema reconciliation workflows SHOULD verify coverage of all top-level properties in `docs/awf-config.schema.json` against the CLI mapping table in `docs/awf-config-spec.md` on every run.

**CR-05**: When drift is detected, the detecting agent or workflow SHOULD open a corrective pull request with specific field paths and suggested remediation.

**CR-06**: Drift categorized as "missing in gh-aw" or "spec mismatch" MUST be remediated (merged or explicitly waived with rationale) within **5 business days** of detection. For this requirement, business days are Monday-Friday in UTC, excluding weekends. If this SLA is missed, maintainers MUST open (or update) an escalation tracking issue within 1 business day. The escalation issue MUST include an owner, unblock plan, and revised ETA.

**CR-06a (Escalation Owner Assignment)**: When opening or updating an escalation tracking issue under CR-06, the assignee **SHOULD** be determined as follows: (a) the maintainer who merged the last change to the drifted property's corresponding implementation file in `pkg/workflow/` or `actions/setup/` is the **default escalation owner** (implementation guidance: this can be determined via `git log` on the relevant file, or through PR merge history); (b) if no such maintainer is identifiable (e.g., the property has never been implemented), the escalation owner **SHOULD** default to the on-call maintainer for the `github/gh-aw` repository at the time of escalation; (c) the assigned owner **MUST** be recorded in the `Owner` field of the escalation issue template and **MUST** acknowledge the assignment by commenting on the issue within 1 business day of assignment. The escalation issue **MUST NOT** be left unassigned. The formal conformance fixture is [T-DR-011](awf-config-sources-compliance/README.md#driftrecord-conformance-tests), implemented in `pkg/workflow/awf_config_safeguards_formal_test.go`; production issue assignment and comment-based acknowledgement enforcement are not yet automated. Until a dedicated production tracker exists, that enforcement is explicitly out of scope for T-DR-011 because the current fixture only validates the normative owner-selection and acknowledgement-window contract, not GitHub issue mutation side effects.

## 7. Drift Detection Procedure

This section describes the concrete steps for detecting schema drift between `gh-aw-firewall` and `gh-aw`.

### Approach

Drift detection uses a fetch-compare-report loop (Section 7.2) rather than a schema-diff bot for three reasons:

1. **Two independent canonical sources must agree, not just diff cleanly.** A schema-diff bot would only compare `docs/awf-config.schema.json` against `src/awf-config-schema.json` (or a prior snapshot) for structural changes. This spec also requires reconciling the CLI mapping table in `docs/awf-config-spec.md` (CR-01, CR-02) against schema properties — a semantic comparison a generic diff tool cannot express, since a field can be structurally unchanged in the schema while its CLI mapping documentation still drifts from `gh-aw` implementation behavior.
2. **Drift classification requires implementation-aware context.** Categorizing a drift item as `missing_in_ghaw`, `missing_in_schema`, or `spec_mismatch` (Section 7.2, Step 4) requires cross-referencing `pkg/workflow/` and `actions/setup/` implementation references, not just the two schema/spec artifacts. A schema-diff bot operating only on `github/gh-aw-firewall` content has no visibility into `github/gh-aw` implementation state.
3. **Safeguards require explicit degraded-mode handling.** Section 8's safeguards (snapshot freshness, skip-destructive-actions-when-stale) depend on the fetch step's success/failure being observable and actionable within the same procedure. A separate schema-diff bot would need its own redundant fetch-and-cache logic to support these safeguards, duplicating state rather than sharing one fetch-compare-report loop.

This rationale is why Section 7.2 is written as an explicit numbered procedure (fetch, extract, compare, classify, report, remediate) instead of delegating to an off-the-shelf schema-diff tool.

### 7.1 When to Run

Drift detection MUST be triggered when:

1. A pull request modifies `docs/awf-config.schema.json`, `src/awf-config-schema.json`, or `docs/awf-config-spec.md` in `github/gh-aw-firewall`.
2. A scheduled workflow runs the reconciliation check (RECOMMENDED: daily or weekly).
3. An agent is asked to generate or validate AWF config behavior.

### 7.2 Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Fetch the canonical sources** from `github/gh-aw-firewall`:
   - `docs/awf-config.schema.json` — published schema
   - `src/awf-config-schema.json` — runtime schema
   - `docs/awf-config-spec.md` — normative specification

2. **Extract the property inventory** from both schema files:
   - List all top-level and nested property keys.
   - Note which properties have corresponding CLI flags (as documented in `docs/awf-config-spec.md`).
   - Note which properties are config-only (no CLI flag).

3. **Compare against gh-aw implementation**:
   - For each schema property, check whether `pkg/workflow/` or `actions/setup/` in `github/gh-aw` references it.
   - For each CLI-mapped property, check whether the CLI flag is tested in `pkg/workflow/` tests.

4. **Identify drift categories**:
   - **Missing in gh-aw**: Property exists in schema but `gh-aw` has no coverage.
   - **Missing in schema**: `gh-aw` generates a field not present in either schema.
   - **Spec mismatch**: CLI mapping in `gh-aw` disagrees with the normative spec description.

5. **Produce a drift report** (T-DR-010) listing:
   - Each drifted property path (e.g., `apiProxy.anthropicAutoCache`).
   - Drift category (missing in gh-aw / missing in schema / spec mismatch).
   - Suggested corrective action (add coverage, open PR, update spec).

6. **Open a corrective PR** when any drift of category "missing in gh-aw" or "spec mismatch" is found. The PR description MUST include the drift report and reference this procedure.

### 7.3 Example Drift Check (CLI)

```bash
# Requires GH_TOKEN (or GITHUB_TOKEN) with repo read access
: "${GH_TOKEN:?Set GH_TOKEN (or map GITHUB_TOKEN to GH_TOKEN) before running this check}"

# Fetch both schema files from gh-aw-firewall
gh api /repos/github/gh-aw-firewall/contents/docs/awf-config.schema.json \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d > /tmp/published-schema.json

gh api /repos/github/gh-aw-firewall/contents/src/awf-config-schema.json \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d > /tmp/runtime-schema.json

# Extract nested schema property paths
jq -r '
  def walk_props(prefix):
    (.properties // {} | to_entries[]) as $p
    | ($p.key) as $k
    | ((if prefix == "" then $k else prefix + "." + $k end)),
      ($p.value | walk_props(if prefix == "" then $k else prefix + "." + $k end));
  walk_props("")
' /tmp/published-schema.json | sort -u > /tmp/schema-keys.txt

# Compare against awf-config references in gh-aw implementation
rg --no-heading --no-filename --only-matching 'apiProxy\.[A-Za-z0-9_.]+' pkg/workflow actions/setup \
  | sort -u > /tmp/ghaw-refs.txt

# Review diff for drift
# Keep command non-fatal so investigators can review drift output before deciding whether to fail the run.
diff -u /tmp/schema-keys.txt /tmp/ghaw-refs.txt || true
```

### 7.4 Automation

A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow in `github/gh-aw` SHOULD automate this procedure. The workflow SHOULD:

- Run on a daily schedule and on pull requests that touch AWF config handling.
- Fail the check (non-zero exit) when any "missing in gh-aw" drift is found.
- Post a summary comment on PRs with the drift report.
- Create a tracking issue when drift is detected on the scheduled run.

Current implementation reference: [`/.github/workflows/schema-consistency-checker.md`](../.github/workflows/schema-consistency-checker.md) (scheduled daily) is the tracked drift-detection workflow path for schema consistency checks and SHOULD include AWF config source drift checks from this section.

#### 7.4.1 Drift SLA tracking (CR-06)

To satisfy CR-06 tracking obligations, drift escalation records SHOULD use:

- **Label(s)**: `workflow` + `bug` (both exist in `github/gh-aw`)
- **Escalation issue title prefix**: `[Schema Drift SLA]`
- **Escalation template** (minimum required fields):

```markdown
## Schema Drift SLA Escalation

- Drift detected on: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Source workflow run: <run-url>
- Owner: <github-handle>
- Unblock plan:
  1. ...
  2. ...
- Revised ETA (UTC): <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Waiver rationale (if any): <text>
```

The scheduled schema consistency workflow SHOULD open or update one such issue when drift remains unresolved beyond 5 business days.

### 7.5 DriftRecord Entity Schema

A `DriftRecord` represents a single detected schema drift item produced by the drift detection procedure (Section 7.2, Step 5). The canonical schema definition, field reference, and implementation sync notes for `DriftRecord` are in **Section 3.1**. All automation and agents that produce or consume drift reports **MUST** use the schema defined in Section 3.1 for structured drift output.

#### 7.5.1 Usage

The drift detection procedure (Section 7.2, Step 5) **MUST** produce a list of zero or more `DriftRecord` objects (schema: Section 3.1; T-DR-009). When any record has `drift_category` of `missing_in_ghaw` or `spec_mismatch`, the detecting automation **MUST** open a corrective PR (CR-05; T-DR-006) and, if the SLA window is exceeded, an escalation issue (CR-06; T-DR-007). The corrective PR description **MUST** embed the full `DriftRecord` list as JSON (T-DR-008).

**Example output (Step 5 of the drift detection procedure):**

```json
[
  {
    "property_path": "apiProxy.anthropicAutoCache",
    "drift_category": "missing_in_ghaw",
    "suggested_action": "Add coverage for apiProxy.anthropicAutoCache in pkg/workflow/ and reconcile CLI mapping in docs/awf-config-spec.md.",
    "detected_at": "2026-05-17T16:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## 8. REASONS Canvas

### Safeguards

Every invocation (scheduled, manual, or ad hoc) **MUST** attempt to refresh the canonical sources and evaluate snapshot freshness. When canonical sources in `github/gh-aw-firewall` are unavailable (GitHub outage, auth failure, transient fetch errors), agents and automation MUST apply the following safeguards:

1. The workflow **MUST** attempt to use the last-known validated local snapshot (for example cached schema/spec artifacts from the previous successful run) to keep checks deterministic. The snapshot **MUST** be stored at a stable, well-known path: `~/.cache/gh-aw/schema-consistency/last-known-snapshot/` on self-hosted runners or `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/schema-consistency/last-known-snapshot/` when the runner is ephemeral. The workflow **MUST** record the UTC refresh time when, and only when, all canonical sources refresh successfully. Snapshots older than **7 days** (168 hours from that recorded successful refresh) **MUST** be treated as expired and **MUST NOT** be used to suppress drift warnings; when a snapshot is expired, the run **MUST** be marked degraded even if the snapshot files are physically present. Implementations **SHOULD** delete snapshots older than 14 days to prevent unbounded disk use. (T-DR-SAFE-001; see the [fixture index](awf-config-sources-compliance/README.md#safeguards-conformance-tests))
2. The workflow **SHOULD** emit a warning that canonical source retrieval failed, including the failing source path(s) and timestamp. (T-DR-SAFE-002; see the [fixture index](awf-config-sources-compliance/README.md#safeguards-conformance-tests))
3. The workflow **MUST** skip destructive validation actions (for example failing required checks, auto-opening corrective PRs, or auto-creating drift issues from stale snapshots) when canonical data cannot be refreshed, and mark the run as degraded instead of silently passing. (T-DR-SAFE-003; see the [fixture index](awf-config-sources-compliance/README.md#safeguards-conformance-tests))
4. The workflow **SHOULD** open or update a tracking issue when canonical source unavailability persists from one daily scheduled cron invocation through the next. Manual reruns and ad hoc invocations still perform the refresh and freshness checks above, but do not advance this consecutive-scheduled-run threshold. This persistence threshold applies only to unavailable-source reporting; the daily cadence in §7.4 applies to the full drift check. (T-DR-SAFE-004; see the [fixture index](awf-config-sources-compliance/README.md#safeguards-conformance-tests))
